`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes.  The North and South areas are split at 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values (set equal to the species-specific Acceptable Biological Catch) for the complex are determined by summing the species-specific contributions for all stocks managed in the complexes. Removals for species within the Nearshore Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.
