`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes.  The North and South areas are split at N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific contributions for all stock managed in the complexes. Removals for species within the Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one south of Point Conception in California and one north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border.  The 2013 assessment estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target, 40 percent of unfished, with the southern area being assessed at 75 percent of unfished and the northern population at 48 percent of unfished. The estimated OFLs and the ACLs from the south and north assessments were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N.
