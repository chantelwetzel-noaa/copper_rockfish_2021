`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) using annual catch limits (ACLs) and overfishing limits (OFLs) split North and South of N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. `r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one South of Pt. Conception in California and one North of Pt. Conecption to the Washington/Canadian border.  The 2013 assessed estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target of 40% of unfished conditions with the southern area being assessed at 75% of unfished and the northern population at 48% of unfished. The OFLs and the ACLs from each assessed area were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N.
