The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015], a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior for $M$. This approach modifies work done by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] who estimated $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}$. Hamel (personal communication) re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015], the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 yr^-1^.  The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values.  The oldest aged `r spp` was 51 years with two observations, one each off of the coast of Washington and Oregon in 2019.  The maximum age in the model was set at 50 years.  This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of  `r spp` [@love_milton_probably_1996] and was supported by the observed ages that had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.
