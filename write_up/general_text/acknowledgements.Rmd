Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in facilitating the understanding of the STAT team as to why and wheneach of our assessments either encounter or do not `r spp` along the coast. Melissa Head provided an area specific maturity estimate for `r spp` and provided insight in the complex biological processes that govern maturity processes.   

All of the data moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefitted by the numerous individuals who took the time to particpate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, and Daniel Platt were provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the `r spp` assessments conducted this year.
