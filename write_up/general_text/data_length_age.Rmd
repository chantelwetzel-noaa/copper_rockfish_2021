The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington that were collected from 1998-2019 (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)`

Males $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1[1], 3)`

\end{centering}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female `r spp`.
