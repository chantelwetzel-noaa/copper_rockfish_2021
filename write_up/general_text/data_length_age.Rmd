The length-at-age was estimated for male and female `r spp` using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}).  The fishery-dependent had limited observations of young fish (less that 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ($k$) and the size-at-age 0 ($t_0$) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ($L_{\infty}$). A published growth study for `r spp` by Lea [-@lea_biological_1999] had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female `r spp` that were used in this assessment.  Ideally growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observation that did not cover the range of ages. Future research should be conducted to collect a range of lengths by area which would allow for estimates of `r spp` growth.   

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)`

Males $L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1[1], 3)`

\end{centering}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female `r spp`. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for `r spp`, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.  

In contrast, the length-at-age values cited in the 2013 data-moderate assessment [@cope_data-moderate_2013] for `r spp` (although not directly used by the data-moderate model) were from Lea [-@lea_biological_1999]. The $L_{\infty}$ from the Lea study were quite a bit larger for both sexes than those estimated for this assessment using recent length and age data off the coast of Oregon and Washington. In the Lea [-@lea_biological_1999] young fish were well sampled, however, there were very few observations of fish older than 12 years of age (less than 5 total) which appears to have led to a poorly informed estimate of $L_{\infty}$.
