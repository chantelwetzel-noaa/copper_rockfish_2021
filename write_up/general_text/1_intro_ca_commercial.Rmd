In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willingness to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs. or 0.5 - 1.4 kgs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs. or 1.4 - 2.7 kgs.), with small fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between $5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication).  The proportion of `r spp` being landed live vs. dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. `r Spp` is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California.
