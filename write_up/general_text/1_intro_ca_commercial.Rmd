The California recreational fisher in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time [@miller_spatially_2014].  Prior to the rebuilding period for overfished species after the groundfish fishery disaster was declared in 2000, there was access to all depths and year-round seasons for groundfish.  Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species on the shelf as well as the nearshore.  This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions were put in place in various management area delineations along the state, shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increasing catch nearshore rockfish including `r spp`.  After rebuilding of overfished groundfish species other than yelloweye rockfish by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm, though north of Point Conception constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area.  As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected to continue, reducing the focus of effort on nearshore waters where `r spp` is most prevalent.

Prior to development of the live-fish market in the 1980s, commercial catch of `r spp` was relatively low and were often landed dead for a relatively low ex-vessel price per pound. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and in some instances with trawl gear. Whether from directed effort in the nearshore or as bycatch while targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod, catches by the commercial fishery of `r spp` were relatively low.  

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs. or 0.5 - 1.4 kgs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs. or 1.4 - 2.7 kgs.), with small fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between $5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication).  The proportion of `r spp` being landed live vs. dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. `r Spp` is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California. 
 
With the development and expansion of the nearshore live-fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain `r spp`, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date.  The result was reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels.  In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.   
 
As overfished shelf rockfish have rebuilt, resumed access to deeper depths has been allowed for Nearshore Permit holders as well as open access fisheries. While deeper depth restrictions of 75 fm were implemented in 2019 south of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are uncommon, it still constrains depth restrictions north of Point Conception where depth restrictions are 30 to 40 fm since 2015 depending on the management area. As open access fisheries allowed to retain shelf rockfish species co-occurring with nearshore rockfish species within the open depths, there is growing concern regarding increased encounters by non-permit holders and greater discard mortality from bycatch in deeper depths as discard mortality is 100 percent in depths greater than 30 fm.  This is of particular concern considering increased trip limits for shelf rockfish species in combination with increased depth restrictions allowing access to these species, driving increased participation in the open access fishery exacerbating discard mortality.  In addition, sampling rates for observers from the West Coast Observer Program (WCGOP) on small vessels participating in these fisheries provide limited data to inform bycatch rates.  Under National Standard 8, reduction of bycatch is a priority and increased observer rates would improve data on discards as the open access fishery for shelf rockfish expands.
