The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions. The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits.
