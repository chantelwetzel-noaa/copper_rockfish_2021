A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured to include the area from north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The data types used in the 2013 assessment were catches and indices of abundance.  Matching the 2013 data was not straight forward based aside from the challenges already posed from the alternative model platform (XDB-SRA) and area grouping. First, the 2013 assessment document did not report the used catches on a state and source level (not atypical for grouped state or area assessment). Secondly, some of the  recreational indices used in 2013 were calculated based on multi-state data. All of these items created significant challenges of how to conduct an effective, logical, and informative bridge analysis.
