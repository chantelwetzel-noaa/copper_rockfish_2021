Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model.  The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with  an assumed maximum age of 50 years. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.108 yr^-1^ and a standard error of 0.438. 

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard error of 0.15. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA), which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.
