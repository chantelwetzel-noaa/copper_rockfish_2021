The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the NWFSC Hook and Line survey (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-survey}). The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was W = `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ and males `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Mal[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Mal[1], 2)`^ where $L$ is length in cm and W is weight in kilograms (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight}).
