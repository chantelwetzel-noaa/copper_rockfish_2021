NEED TO UPDATE WHEN MELISSA IS DONE

Maturity-at-length based on the work of Hannah XXX which estimated the 50% size-at-maturity of 34.83 cm off the coast of Oregon with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure ADD FIGURE).

This assessment assumed a logistic maturity-at-length curve based on analysis of XXX fish maturity samples collected from the NWFSC WCGBT and NWFSC Hook & Line surveys.  The new maturity-at-length curve is based on the estimate of functional maturity, an approach that classifies rockfish maturity with developing oocytes as mature or immature based on the proportion of vitellogenin in the cytoplasm and the measured frequency of atretic cells (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).  The 50% size-at-maturity was estimated at XX cm with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure ADD FIGURE).  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure ADD FIGURE.
