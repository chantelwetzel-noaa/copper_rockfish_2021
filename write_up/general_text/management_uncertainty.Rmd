The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 2 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 1.0. The forecasts applied the default $\sigma$ and applied the standard rate of increase by year during the 10-year forecast period.
