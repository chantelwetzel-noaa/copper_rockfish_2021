`r Spp` is assessed as four distinct stocks off the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California; north of Point Conception in California; Oregon; and Washington. The area north of Point Conception off the coast of California was estimated to have the largest unfished spawning output of `r spp` off the West Coast. The stocks off of the Oregon and Washington coast are smaller in size compared to the California stocks, with the stock off the coast of Washington estimated to have the smallest unfished spawning output.  Comparison of the estimated spawning output trajectories for the California stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-ca-compare} with Oregon and Washington shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-orwa-compare}.  The fraction unfished across all West Coast stocks shown in Figure \ref{fig:depl-compare}. The California stocks are estimated to be the most depleted, with the stock south of Point Conception estimated below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished and the stock north of Point Conception estimated to be in the precautionary zone (less than the management target of 40 percent but above the management threshold).  The stock off the coast of Washington is estimated to be just above the management target and the Oregon stock well above the target.
