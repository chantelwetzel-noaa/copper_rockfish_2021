As overfished shelf rockfish have rebuilt, access to deeper depths has once again been allowed for both Nearshore Permit holders and open access fisheries. While depth restrictions of 75 fm were implemented in 2019 and increased to 100 fm in 2021 south of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are uncommon, depth restrictions north of Point Conception have remained at 30 to 40 fm since 2015, with the exception of 50 fm in Central California in 2021.  Open access  fisheries are allowed to retain shelf rockfish species that co-occurr with nearshore rockfish species within the open depths, creating concern regarding increased encounters by non-permit holders who cannot retain them and greater discard mortality from bycatch in deeper depths, as discard mortality is 100 percent in depths greater than 30 fm. This is of particular concern given both increased trip limits for shelf rockfish species and less constraining depth restrictions allowing more access to these species, both of which drive increased participation in the open access fishery and therefore increased total discard mortality. In addition, a low proportion of open access trips carry observers from the West Coast Observer Program (WCGOP) on the small vessels participating in these fisheries providing limited data to  inform bycatch rates. Under National Standard 8, reduction of bycatch is a priority and increased observer rates would improve data on discards as the open access fishery for shelf rockfish expands.
