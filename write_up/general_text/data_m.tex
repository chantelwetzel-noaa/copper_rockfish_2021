The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and SE = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 per year.  The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources.  The oldest aged rockfish was XX years, captured by the recrational fishery of the coast of XXX state in XXX.  However, age data are subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity.  The selection of 50 years was based on the range of other ages available across data sources and available longevitity literature for `spp`.
