## Fishery-Independent Data

### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus *Sebastes* at fixed stations (e.g., sites) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the `r hkl` are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [@harms_noaa_2008]. 

`r Spp` have been observed at multiple sampling site by the `r hkl` survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}).  Starting in 2014 the `r hkl` added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA).  `r Spp` have been observed both outside and inside the CCA (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-cca}).  The number of observations limited the ability to determine whether the CCA impacted the frequency and sizes of `r spp` compared to the other areas sampled. The `r hkl` generally observed `r spp` between 30 - 50 cm of both sexes (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The mean length observed by year was variable with appreciable drop in the mean sized observed in 2012 but has gradually increased in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}). Detailed length compositions by year can be found in [Appendix A](#append_a).

An annual index of abundance was calculated from the `r hkl` data following the methods put forth in Harms et al. [-@harms_analysis_2010] based on the AIC criterion. The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and swell height as covariates.  The single index of abundance was calculated using both observation outside and within the CCA (Table \ref{tab:hkl-index-vals} and Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index}).  

The input sample sizes were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year. 

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The observations of `r spp` by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} were limited (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}). Sine the \Gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast,**apriori** it would not be expected to be an informative data source for `r spp` which are closely associated with rock substrate. The \Gls{s-wcgbt} had  limited tows by year where `r spp` were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance for `r spp`. With limited length observations and in the absence of an index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.
