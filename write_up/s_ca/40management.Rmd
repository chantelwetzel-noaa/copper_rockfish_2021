A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated ACL for years 2023-2032 with all removals allocated to the recreational fleet (Table \ref{tab:projectionES}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) DESCRIBE ALLOCATION ASSUMPTIONS
