## Model Diagnostics


### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 25%. This was repeated 100 times with 83 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian. 


### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Deterministic recruitment from the stock recruitment curve. 

  \item Fix selectivity for the commercial fleet to be asymptotic. 
  
  \item Fix selectivity for the recreational fleet to be asymptotic. 
    
  \item Fix selectivity for both the commercial and recreational fleets to be asymptotic. 
  
  \item Remove the `r hkl` index of abundance and length data. 

  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli method using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet method where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table XXX.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures XXX and XXX.


### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}).  


### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, female maximum length, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). 

(Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occuring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  Assuming higher or lower steepness values had minimal impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status ranged between around the minumum threshold (0.25) to above the management target depending upon assuming a lower or higher steepness value (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortatliy supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). 

(Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}). 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}).  The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between 48 and 50 cm. The $L_{\infty}$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` based on length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status is quite variable across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

A profile across a range of female $k$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile}).  The negative log-likelihood showed support for values from 0.14 and higher. The $k$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` based on length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status increases under lower $k$ values where assuming higher values resulted in decreases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}).
