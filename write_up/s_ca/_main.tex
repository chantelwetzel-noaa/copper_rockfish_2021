This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the California coast, south of Point Conception, using data through 2020.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial (mainly in the live-fish fishery in recent years) and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring or copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub-division has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterrey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish is a relatively long-lived rockfish and are estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Off the coast of California southth of Point Conception copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality of copper rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The recreational fishery is comprised of individual recreational fishers and charter recreational private vessels which take groups of individuals out for day fishing trips. Across both types of recreational fishing the majority of effort occurs around rocky reefs that can be accessed via a day-trips.

In the late 1980s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willingness to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs. or 0.5 - 1.4 kgs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs. or 1.4 - 2.7 kgs.), with small fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between \$5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The population of copper rockfish south of Point Conception to the U.S./Mexico border is assessed here as a separate stock. This decision was made based on oceanographic conditions and previous assessments of copper rockfish. The stock split in California waters at Point Conception accounts for water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish population north and south of the area.

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one south of Point Conception in California and one north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessment estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target of 40 percent of unfished conditions with the southern area being assessed at 75 percent of unfished and the northern population at 48 percent of unfished. The OFLs and the ACLs from each assessed area were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

Although, management defines OFLs and ACLs north and south of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. management areas, copper rockfish in California are managed based on the portion of OFL and ACL allocated to California. The OFLs and ACLs for south of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

The commercial removals for copper rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \{tab:allcatches\} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl', and `unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports North of Point Conception. To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table XXX). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for further details.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted XX, 2021. Landings were separated for the area South of Pt. Conception based on port of landings. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Length data for the commercial fleet were available starting in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). The number of total lengths available was highly variable ranging from a low of 2 to 542 samples per year. The samples prior to 1995 were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations these low sample years appeared to have a disproportionate impact on selectivity estimates and the decision of removing these samples from the base model (treated as a `ghost' fleet, see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for implied fits to these lengths).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet were between approximately 25 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}) with relatively low observations of fish larger than 45 cm (detailed length compositions by year can be found in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The mean length observed by year ranged between 32 - 39 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The mean length across commercial lengths was the smallest in 2014 (around 32 cm) and has generally incrementally in the subsequent years.

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which were available split north and south of Pt. Conception. Recreational removals from 1980 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS and 1993-2020 were obtained from RecFIN. Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish. The missing years between the MRFSS and RecFIN data years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. The MRFSS and RecFIN removals included landings plus estimated discards. For years prior to 1980 a historical discard rate of 3 percent was assumed based on Miller and Gotshall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1965)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish. The recreational catches of copper rockfish south of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined in the 1990s and early 2000s. The removals remained relatively low until 2015 and after. The increase in removals in 2015 is likely due to new Annual Catch Limits being updated based on the 2013 assessment {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Recreational length data was available starting in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}). The total length samples per year was relatively low until 2004, the first year with 200+ samples, and increased substantially starting in 2012. The length data from the recreational fleet generally ranged between 25 to approximately 45 cm\\
(Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}) with limited observations of fish greater than 45 cm. The annual mean length observed was relatively stable between 2004 and 2011, followed by a minor dip in mean size and slight increase in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}). Detailed length compositions by year can be found in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-sites}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the NWFSC Hook and Line are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Harms, Benante, and Barnhart 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling site by the NWFSC Hook and Line survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). Starting in 2014 the NWFSC Hook and Line added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA). Copper rockfish have been observed both outside and inside the CCA (Figures \ref{fig:hkl-site-ob} and \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). The number of observations limited the ability to determine whether the CCA impacted the frequency and sizes of copper rockfish compared to the other areas sampled. Copper rockfish were observed at sites with depth ranging between 40 - 120 m with only the largest sizes being observed at the greatest depths (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-dep}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The NWFSC Hook and Line generally observed copper rockfish between 30 - 50 cm of both sexes (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}). The mean length observed by year was variable with appreciable drop in the mean sized observed in 2012 but has gradually increased in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-hkl-len-data}). Detailed length compositions by year can be found in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The input sample sizes for the composition data were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year.

The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and swell height as covariates.

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Bradburn, Keller, and Horness 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The observations of copper rockfish by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} were limited (Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}). The \Gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast and \emph{apriori} it would not be expected to be an informative data source for copper rockfish which are closely associated with rock substrate. The \Gls{s-wcgbt} had limited tows by year where copper rockfish were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance for copper rockfish. With limited length observations and in the absence of an index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} by fitting the one-parameter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), the point estimate for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is:

This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and was supported by the observed ages which had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish south of Pt. Conception using data combined across multiple sources. Variable oceangraphic conditions north and south of Pt. Conception, differences in growth patterns in the same species among areas may occur. Ideally a full area specific growth curve would be estimated for both sexes ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L2\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} within SS) would be estimated based on a single age and growth study, however, given limitation in ageing capacity developing a targeted approach was applied. The Cooperative Ageing Program (CAP) selected a subsample of larger (greater then 35 cm) of copper rockfish observed by both the NWFSC Hook and Line and the \Gls{s-wcgbt} survey (Figure \ref{fig:survey-len-at-age-data}). These observations were combined with simulated data based on a growth study from the south of Pt. Conception area. A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed in the survey data sources (Figure \ref{fig:south-len-at-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. The length-at-age observations from the survey collected fish shown minimal differences to those collected off the Oregon and Washington coast from fishery-dependent sources (Figure \ref{fig:len-at-age-comp}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimated growth used in this assessment had female and males with similar growth. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 47.4 cm; $k$ = 0.231

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.1 cm; $k$ = 0.238

\end{centering}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was selected in the anticipation of growth differences that were not observed. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.

Maturity-at-length was based on maturity reads conducted by Melissa Head at the NWFSC examining a total of 111 samples collect South of Pt. Conception by the NWFSC Hook and Line and \Gls{s-wcgbt} surveys. The maturity-at-length curve is based on an estimate of functional maturity rather than biological maturity. Biological maturity can include multiple behaviors that Functional will exclude (i.e., abortive maturation and skip spawning). Biological maturity indicates that some energy reserves were used to create vitellogenin, but it does not mean that eggs will continue to develop and successfully spawn. This includes juvenile abortive maturation. Rockfish commonly do a dummy run the year before they reach actual spawning capability. This is most likely a factor related to their complicated reproductive process of releasing live young.. A subset of oocyte will develop early yolk, and then get aborted during the spawning season. Biological maturity also does not account for the proportion of oocytes in atresia (cellular breakdown and reabsorption), which means that fish that were skipping spawning for the season could be listed as biologically mature and functionally immature (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The 50\% size-at-maturity was estimated at 34.3 cm and slope of -0.37 with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).

Conception based on the work of Hannah {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which estimated the 50\% size-at-maturity of 34.8 cm and slope of -0.60.

Copper rockfish was last assessed in 2013 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with prior on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, the area South of Pt. Conception off the California coast and the area North of Pt. Conception to the Washington Canada border. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock South of Pt. Conception at 75\% of unfished spawning output North of Pt. Conception at 48\% of unfished spawning output.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

A bridging analysis was done to replicate the results from XDB-SRA. XDB-SRA is a delay-difference model that uses a production function to define biomass and dynamics of a stock. XDB-SRA does not explicitly parameterize weight-at-length or length-at-age. The bridge SS model assumed a structure similar to XDB-SRA: single-sex, deterministic recruitment, knife-edged selectivity equal to 50 percent maturity-at-length. The growth in the bridge SS model was based on the biology values provided in the 2013 assessment for copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, although the XDB-SRA does not explicitily define growth. The SS model used the data from the XDB-SRA model: catches and indices, the median parameter values from XDB-SRA: depletion in the year 2000 and natural mortality, and productivity (parameterized via the 3-parameter Ricker Power stock-recruitment function). The SS model replicated the stock status time series from XDB-SRA, but the SS model resulted in a lower stock size time series compared to XDB-SRA (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-1}, red line). This mis-match in scale alone implied a difference in the implied growth (all mature biomass assumed equal) within XD-SRA versus the weight-at-length parametization for SS. The female weight-at-length was adjusted within SS to produce a stock trajectory that matched in scale the results from XDB-SRA (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-1} and \ref{fig:bridge-growth}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Once the matching SS structure was identified, the parameterization of the model was updated in a step-wise fashion by the following steps:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remove the depletion "survey" for the year 2000.
    \item Update all biology to match those applied in the base model (natural mortality, length-weigth, length-at-age, fecundity, and maturity).
    \item Switch to a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship with a steepness value of 0.72, the value in the base model.
    \item Update catches through 2012, lumped into a single fleet.
    \item Add all lengths to the model through 2012, lumped into a single fleet. Allow for asymptotic selectivity estimation using the double normal selectivity parameterization. 
    \item Remove the indices of abundance (fishery dependent - CPFV, CDFW Observer Program) from the XDB-SRA 2013 model.
    \item Add in the NWFSC Hook and Line index of abundance, length data, and fleet specific selectivity curve.
    \item Separate catches and lengths into the fleet structure assumed in the base model. Allow for fleet specific selecitivy estimation.  
    \item Turn on annual recruitment deviations.
\end{enumerate}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Removing the depletion survey resulted in a shift upward in scale and stock status in 2013 (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). Updating the biology included changing the fecundity assumption from it being equal to spawning biomass to in terms of eggs and body size (spawning output). Figure \ref{fig:bridge-ssb-2} shows only the time series in terms of spawning output for ease of visability. The comparable quantity, stock status, was more pessimistic relative to the 2013 XDB-SRA model (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). All subsequent changes or additions to the 2013 model resulted in a more pessimistic view of the stock (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). The largest changes resulted when the length composition data was added and the 2013 fishery-dependent indices removed. The fishery-dependent indices used in the 2013 copper rockfish south model were variable but had a slight increasing trend (see Figure 69 in Cope et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). In contrast, the length data from the recreational fishery, the main source of removals, has limited observation of larger copper rockfish with the peak of the length data distribution around 30 cm. The observed length distribution combined with an asymptotic selectivity assumption resulted in an extreme estimate of stock status.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at . Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1} for females and males, which is the median of the prior. Annual recruitment was deterministic predicted from the stock-recruitment curve. Growth, maturity-at-length, and length-at-weight was fixed as described above in Section \ref{data}. Likelihood profiles were conducted across steepness, natural mortality, and growth parameters to examine the impact of the selected fixed values in the model.

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older copper rockfish are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. After explorations, the commercial and recreational fleets were both allowed to estimate dome-shaped selectivity due to extreme model estimates when forced to be asymptotic. The NWFSC Hook and Line length compositions were best with a limited dome in selectivity for the largest sizes.

The base assessment model for copper rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of copper rockfish off the Washington coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

There were some major sources of uncertainty within this assessment. To improve our understanding of the copper rockfish stock south of Pt. Conception the following research and data collection should be prioritized:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The commercial and recreational fisheries had limited observations of larger copper rockfish.  It is unclear whether this was due to lack of access to larger individuals or a truncation of the length/age distribution due to fishing effort. Targeted fishery-independent survey information (via. hook and line or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) could improve our understanding the status of copper rockfish in this region.

    \item The assessment area appears to have a mixture of observations from areas experiencing variable fishing effort.  In the region there are likely a mixture of areas: open access rocky reefs that are close to port that are heavily fished, open access rocky reefs that are inaccessible via day-trips that are fished but likely lower levels, and rocky reefs that fall within marine protect areas.  A spatially explicit assessment model may be able to capture this complexity but will require data (indices of abundance and composition data) from each of the regions. 

    \item There are very limited age data for copper rockfish south of Pt. Conception. Increasing otolith sampling and allocating otolith reading resources would improve the understanding of the population structure and life history.
