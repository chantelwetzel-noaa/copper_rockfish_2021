This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the California coast, south of Point Conception, using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial (mainly in the live-fish fishery in recent years) and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring of copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub division has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterrey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a relatively long-lived rockfish and are estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This analysis calculated species specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history, and susceptibility characterized by how the stock is likely affected by the fishery in question.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Off the coast of California south of Point Conception copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality of copper rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The recreational fishery is comprised of individual recreational fishers and charter recreational private vessels which take groups of individuals out for day fishing trips. Across both types of recreational fishing the majority of effort occurs around rocky reefs that can be accessed via a day-trips.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The California recreational fisher in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Prior to the rebuilding period for overfished species after the groundfish fishery disaster was declared in 2000, there was access to all depths and year-round seasons for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species on the shelf as well as the nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions were put in place in various management area delineations along the state, shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increasing catch nearshore rockfish including copper rockfish. After rebuilding of overfished groundfish species other than yelloweye rockfish by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm, though north of Point Conception constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area. As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected to continue, reducing the focus of effort on nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Prior to development of the live-fish market in the 1980s, commercial catch of copper rockfish was relatively low and were often landed dead for a relatively low ex-vessel price per pound. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and in some instances with trawl gear. Whether from directed effort in the nearshore or as bycatch while targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod, catches by the commercial fishery of copper rockfish were relatively low.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs. or 0.5 - 1.4 kgs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs. or 1.4 - 2.7 kgs.), with small fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between \$5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). The proportion of copper rockfish being landed live vs.~dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live-fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wilson-Vandenberg, Larinto, and Key 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain copper rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date. The result was reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

As overfished shelf rockfish have rebuilt, resumed access to deeper depths has been allowed for Nearshore Permit holders as well as open access fisheries. While deeper depth restrictions of 75 fm were implemented in 2019 south of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are uncommon, it still constrains depth restrictions north of Point Conception where depth restrictions are 30 to 40 fm since 2015 depending on the management area. As open access fisheries allowed to retain shelf rockfish species co-occurring with nearshore rockfish species within the open depths, there is growing concern regarding increased encounters by non-permit holders and greater discard mortality from bycatch in deeper depths as discard mortality is 100 percent in depths greater than 30 fm. This is of particular concern considering increased trip limits for shelf rockfish species in combination with increased depth restrictions allowing access to these species, driving increased participation in the open access fishery exacerbating discard mortality. In addition, sampling rates for observers from the West Coast Observer Program (WCGOP) on small vessels participating in these fisheries provide limited data to inform bycatch rates. Under National Standard 8, reduction of bycatch is a priority and increased observer rates would improve data on discards as the open access fishery for shelf rockfish expands.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The population of copper rockfish south of Point Conception to the U.S./Mexico border is assessed here as a separate stock. This decision was made based on oceanographic conditions and previous assessments of copper rockfish. The stock split in California waters at Point Conception accounts for water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish population north and south of the area.

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific contributions for all stock managed in the complexes. Removals for species within the Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one south of Point Conception in California and one north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessment estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target, 40 percent of unfished, with the southern area being assessed at 75 percent of unfished and the northern population at 48 percent of unfished. The estimated OFLs and the ACLs from the south and north assessments were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

Although, management defines OFLs and ACLs north and south of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. management areas, copper rockfish in California are managed based on the portion of OFL and ACL allocated to California. The OFLs and ACLs for south of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

The commercial removals for copper rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969 were pulled from the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl', and `unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports north of Point Conception. To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-80 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1980 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for further details.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database (extracted 2/22/2021). Landings were separated for the area south of Point Conception based on port of landings. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on WCGOP data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

Length data for the commercial fleet were pulled from PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples for south of Point Conception beginning in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). The number of total lengths available was highly variable ranging from a low of 2 to 542 samples per year. The samples prior to 1995 were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations these low sample years appeared to have a disproportionate impact on selectivity estimates and the decision of removing these samples from the base model (treated as a `ghost' fleet, see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for implied fits to these lengths).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet were between approximately 25 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}) with relatively low observations of fish larger than 45 cm (detailed length compositions by year can be found in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The mean length observed by year ranged between 32 - 39 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The mean length across commercial lengths was the smallest in 2014 (around 32 cm) and has generally incrementally in the subsequent years.

The California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) provided estimates from 2004 to 2020, downloaded from RecFIN. Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish. The missing years between the MRFSS and RecFIN data years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. For years prior to 1980 a historical discard rate of 3 percent was assumed based on Miller and Gotshall {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1965)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish. The recreational catches of copper rockfish south of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined in the 1990s and early 2000s. The removals remained relatively low until 2015 and after. The increase in removals in 2015 is likely due to new Annual Catch Limits being updated based on the 2013 assessment {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-sites}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Harms, Benante, and Barnhart 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling sites by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). Starting in 2014 the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA). Copper rockfish have been observed both outside and inside the CCA (Figures \ref{fig:hkl-site-ob} and \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). The number of observations limited the ability to determine whether the CCA impacted the frequency and sizes of copper rockfish compared to the other areas sampled. Copper rockfish were observed at sites with depth ranging between 40 - 120 m with only the largest sizes being observed at the greatest depths (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-dep}).

This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish south of Point Conception using data combined across multiple sources.

Ideally a full area specific growth curve would be estimated for both sexes ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L2\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} within SS) would be estimated based on a single age and growth study, however, given limitation in ageing capacity developing a targeted approach was applied. The Cooperative Ageing Program (CAP) selected a subsample of larger (greater than 35 cm) of copper rockfish observed by both the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey and the \Gls{s-wcgbt} survey (Figure \ref{fig:survey-len-at-age-data}). These observations were combined with simulated data based on a growth study from the south of Point Conception area. A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed in the survey data sources (Figure \ref{fig:south-len-at-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. The length-at-age observations from the survey collected fish shown minimal differences to those collected off the Oregon and Washington coast from fishery-dependent sources (Figure \ref{fig:len-at-age-comp}).

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was selected in the anticipation of growth differences that were not observed.

Maturity-at-length was based on maturity reads conducted by Melissa Head at the NWFSC examining a total of 111 samples collected south of Point Conception by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey and \Gls{s-wcgbt}. The maturity-at-length curve is based on an estimate of functional maturity rather than biological maturity. Biological maturity can include multiple behaviors that Functional will exclude (i.e., abortive maturation and skip spawning). Biological maturity indicates that some energy reserves were used to create vitellogenin, but it does not mean that eggs will continue to develop and successfully spawn. This includes juvenile abortive maturation. Rockfish commonly do a dummy run the year before they reach actual spawning capability. This is most likely a factor related to their complicated reproductive process of releasing live young. A subset of oocyte will develop early yolk, and then get aborted during the spawning season. Biological maturity also does not account for the proportion of oocytes in atresia (cellular breakdown and reabsorption), which means that fish that were skipping spawning for the season could be listed as biologically mature and functionally immature (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).

Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, split north and south of Point Conception.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

A bridging analysis was done to replicate the results from XDB-SRA. XDB-SRA is a delay-difference model that uses a production function to define biomass and dynamics of a stock. XDB-SRA does not explicitly parameterize weight-at-length or length-at-age. The bridge Stock Synthesis (SS) model assumed a structure similar to XDB-SRA: single-sex, deterministic recruitment, knife-edged selectivity equal to 50 percent maturity-at-length. The growth in the bridge SS model was based on the biology values provided in the 2013 assessment for copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, although the XDB-SRA does not explicitly define growth. The bridge model used the data from the XDB-SRA model: catches and indices, the median parameter values from XDB-SRA: depletion in the year 2000 and natural mortality, and productivity (parameterized via the 3-parameter Ricker Power stock-recruitment function).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The bridge model estimated stock status time series matched the estimate from XDB-SRA but estimated a reduced stock size across time compared to XDB-SRA (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-1}, red line). This mis-match in scale alone implied a difference in the implied growth (all mature biomass assumed equal) within XD-SRA versus the weight-at-length parameterization for the SS bridge model. The female weight-at-length was adjusted within the bridge model to produce a stock trajectory that matched in scale the results from XDB-SRA (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-1} and \ref{fig:bridge-growth}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Once the matching bridge structure was identified, the parameterization of the model was updated in a step-wise fashion by the following steps:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remove the depletion "survey" for the year 2000.
    \item Update all biology to match those applied in the base model (natural mortality, length-weight, length-at-age, fecundity, and maturity).
    \item Switch to a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship with a steepness value of 0.72, the value in the base model.
    \item Update catches through 2012, lumped into a single fleet.
    \item Add all lengths to the model through 2012, lumped into a single fleet. Allow for asymptotic selectivity estimation using the double normal selectivity parameterization. 
    \item Remove the indices of abundance used in the 2013 XDB-SRA model.
    \item Add in the NWFSC Hook and Line index of abundance, length data, and fleet specific selectivity curve.
    \item Separate catches and lengths into the fleet structure assumed in the base model. Allow for fleet specific selectivity estimation.  
    \item Turn on annual recruitment deviations.
\end{enumerate}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Removing the depletion survey resulted in a shift upward in scale and stock status in 2013 (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). Updating the biology included changing the fecundity assumption from it being equal to spawning biomass to in terms of eggs and body size (spawning output). Figure \ref{fig:bridge-ssb-2} shows only the time series in terms of spawning output for ease of visibility. The comparable quantity, stock status, was more pessimistic relative to the 2013 XDB-SRA model (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). All subsequent changes or additions to the 2013 model resulted in a more pessimistic view of the stock (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). The largest changes resulted when the length composition data was added and the 2013 fishery-dependent indices removed. The fishery-dependent indices used in the 2013 copper rockfish south model were variable but had a slight increasing trend (see Figure 69 in Cope et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The length data from the recreational fishery, the main source of removals, has limited observation of larger copper rockfish with the peak of the length data distribution around 30 cm. The observed length distribution combined with an asymptotic selectivity assumption resulted in an extreme estimate of stock status.

Copper rockfish south of Point Conception were assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters. The model assumed two fishing fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in 1916 and one survey fleet, NWFSC Hook and Line Survey. Selectivity was specified for all fleets in the model using the double normal parameterization within SS. The selectivity for the commercial and recreational fleets were allowed to estimate dome-shaped selectivity and the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic.

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard error of 0.15.

However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

The base model was weighted using the ``Francis method'', which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model.

The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity for both the commercial and recreational fleets were estimated to be dome-shaped, with reduced selectivity for larger copper rockfish. A dome-shaped selectivity was not anticipated \emph{apriori}; however, forcing one or both of the fleets to have asymptotic selectivity resulted in an extremely depleted stock status (3 percent when both fleets assumed asymptotic selectivity). The highly pessimistic stock status was deemed to have limited plausibility given the ongoing high removals of copper rockfish in recent years. Multiple sensitivities were performed to examine the assumption of dome-shaped selectivity in the base model.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The commercial fleet selectivity peaked at 35.6 cm and decreased to low selectivity rates for larger copper rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:selex}). The recreational fleet selectivity peaked at smaller sizes relative to the commercial fleet with full selectivity occurring at 29.5 cm. The peak selectivity for both the commercial and recreational fleets were less than the length-at-50 percent maturity (34.3 cm).

The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey was fixed to have asymptotic selectivity with full selection starting at 38.5 cm (Figure \ref{fig:selex}). The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey selectivity is markedly different compared to the commercial and recreational fleets. The reason for this difference was speculated to be possibly due to two factors: 1) the survey across years sampling deeper waters that until recently the recreational fishery did not have access to, and 2) many of the observations of large copper rockfish by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey were around areas that would likely require 3/4 day trip if not a full-day or overnight trip (i.e., Santa Rosa Island, San Miguel Island) which would put them out of range of 1/2 day trip recreational fishing efforts (John Harms, personal communication, NOAA, NWFSC).

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. Annual recruitment deviations were not estimated in the base model due to confounding between recent high catches and estimated recruitment deviations. A rise in catches could be related to above average recruitment. However, when recruitment deviations were allowed to be estimated, the estimates of annual recruitment deviations were positively biased in recent years in order to maintain the population biomass greater than 0 (not extinct). This issue was identified by conducting a 20 year retrospective analysis combined with a plot that reflects the model estimated recruitment strength by year as data were removed. When all data were removed that would inform recent recruitment, the recruitment deviations did not decline to 0, but remained positive in order to keep the population biomass from hitting the lower bound of 0 when catches were high (Figure \ref{fig:squid-rec}). The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. Annual recruits estimated directly from the stock-recruitment curve are shown in Figure \ref{fig:recruits}.

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery length data area shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}.

The mean length observed by year from the commercial fleet were uncertain but with a relatively stable mean size until 2014 when the mean length declined and then slowly increase in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, observations greater than expected, for larger fish prior to 2000. Adding a block in selectivity for this period was explored during model development but there was little support in the data for the added model complexity (i.e., similar fits to the data). In recent years there are residual patterns in the length data that likely indicate above average recruitments moving through the population which the model was unable to capture with deterministic recruitment. The mean length in the early period of data ranged between 28 - 38 cm, with a decline and stabilizing of the mean observed length in recent years around 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}).

The Pearson residuals for the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey were variable by year and by sex (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-pearson}). Similar to the other data sources in the model there appears to be a pattern of observations greater than the model expectations moving through the population possibly supporting an above average recruitment event prior to 2011 and 2013.

The model was unable to capture these trends in the index of abundance and estimated a slightly increasing stock until 2013 and then declining in the final years. The index of abundance had relatively high uncertainty intervals (uncertainty estimated in the index development) by years likely due to the limited observations of copper rockfish in the survey. In order to fit the index of abundance the base model estimated added variance (0.2) which is reflected by the thin bars on Figure \ref{fig:index-fit}.

A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

The majority of sensitivities estimated the final stock status to be below the management threshold limit of 25 percent of unfished spawning output, similar o the base model. Estimating annual recruitment deviations from the stock recruitment curve resulted in a more pessimistic final stock status relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). The sensitivity that estimated female natural mortality estimated a lower unfished spawning output but a similar final stock size to the base model (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}).

The two sensitivities that examined alternative parameterization of the recreational selectivity (forced to be asymptotic) estimated a relative stock status of 3 percent in the final year of the model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). Fixing the only the commercial selectivity to be asymptotic resulted in slightly more depleted stock relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The sensitivity that included the onboard CPFV index of abundance from the 2013 assessment estimated a similar stock size and status relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The sensitivity that included the dockside RecFIN index of abundance estimated a larger initial spawning output and higher relative biomass compared to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). Both sensitivities were allowed to estimate additional added variance for the input standard deviation for the index time series which is typical practice in West Coast groundfish stock assessments.

Along the coast of California, over the last couple of decades, a number of marine protected areas that prohibited retention have been created. During model development there was much discussion concerning the model results and whether they reflected the copper rockfish population south of Point Conception as a whole or only reflect the status of the stock in fished areas. In order to attempt to understand how the results could vary if a portion of the population was protected from fishing some simple area-based sensitivities were conducted. These sensitivities make some strong assumptions which likely do not match the real world system. The first major assumption is that the protected areas have experienced no fishing pressure across all model years. The second assumption is that annual recruitment by year is pooled across both protected and fished areas with the proportion of recruitment settling to each area equal to the area protected (e.g., if 20 percent of the population is protected then 20 percent of annual recruitment settles in that area). Three sensitivities were conducted where the percent of protected area was either 10, 15, or 20 percent of the total population.

The likelihood component driving the estimate of the log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) were the length data.

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis which assumes asymptotic selectivity estimating year independent estimates of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit effort on the recreational lengths. This analysis indicated the copper rockfish were 50 percent selected size around 25 cm with full selection between 31 - 32 cm (Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). For comparison, the size at 50 percent length-at-maturity was fixed at 34.3 cm south of Point Conception based on the maturity curve developed for this assessment. The LB-SPR estimate of the size at 50 percent selection assuming asymptotic selectivity was consistent with the base model estimates which estimated peak selectivity (although allowed to be domed) at sizes less than 50 percent maturity (Figure \ref{fig:selex}).

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2010 - 2020 (e.g., Data -10 Year reflects data through 2010). A longer retrospective analysis was conducted to cover years prior to the last assessment in 2013. As years of data were removed the estimates of stock size in recent years declines relative to the base model with the retrospective runs with at least 3 years of removed data having similar stock trajectories (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}).

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields were 51.78 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SB}_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 103.68 millions of eggs.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the management threshold limit of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-\text{SPR}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has been above the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) in recent years, except 2020 when overall removals declined due to impacts of COVID-19 which reduced recreational fishing effort (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). The stock is estimated to be below the management target with fishing intensity exceeding the target across recent years (Figure \ref{fig:phase}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

Since the stock is estimated to be below the management target the buffer applied between the OFL and ABC incorporates both the harvest control rule adjustment and the default time-varying buffer. The removals in 2021 and 2022 were determine by first summing the adopted ACLs South of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

N. allocated to California(25 percent - PFMC Groundfish Management Team pers. comm.).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

There were some major sources of uncertainty within this assessment. To improve our understanding of the copper rockfish stock south of Point Conception the following research and data collection should be prioritized:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The commercial and recreational fisheries had limited observations of larger copper rockfish.  It is unclear whether this was due to lack of access to larger individuals or a truncation of the length/age distribution due to fishing effort. Fishery-independent survey information via. hook and line or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) targeted at areas that are subject to recreational and commercial fishing could improve our understanding the availability of  of copper rockfish.

    \item The assessment area appears to have a mixture of observations from areas experiencing variable fishing effort.  In the region there are likely a mixture of areas: open access rocky reefs that are close to port that are heavily fished, open access rocky reefs that are inaccessible via day-trips that are fished but likely lower levels, and rocky reefs that fall within marine protect areas.  A spatially explicit assessment model may be able to capture this complexity but will require data (indices of abundance and composition data) from each of the regions. 

    \item There are very limited age data for copper rockfish south of Point Conception. The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey was the main source of otoliths read for constructing a age-at-length curve for copper rockfish. Collection otoliths from the recreational fishery, a large source of mortality in the area, would support future assessments  and would improve the understanding of the population structure and life history of copper rockfish.

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in helping the STAT team to understand the data and as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not copper rockfish along the coast. Melissa Head provided an area specific maturity estimate for copper rockfish and provided insight in the complex biological processes that govern maturity processes.

All of the data moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, Bill James, and Daniel Platt provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the copper rockfish assessments conducted this year.
