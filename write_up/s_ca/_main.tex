This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the California coast, south of Point Conception, using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea et al. 1999; Bizzarro et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring of copper rockfish varies across the West Coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish, with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations, but significant population subdivision has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterey California identified a genetic break between the north and south, with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are a relatively long-lived rockfish, estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This analysis calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Off the coast of California south of Point Conception copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality of copper rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The recreational fishery is comprised of individual recreational fishers and charter recreational private vessels which take groups of individuals out for day fishing trips. Across both types of recreational fishing the majority of effort occurs around rocky reefs that can be accessed via a day-trips.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The recreational fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, with expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Prior to the groundfish fishery being declared a federal disaster in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions ranging from 20 fm in the Northern Management Area to 60 fm in the Southern Management Area were put in place in various management area delineations along the state (see Appendix Section \ref{ca-man}). This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including copper rockfish in the remaining open depths, though season lengths were greatly curtailed.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Following all previously overfished groundfish species, other than yelloweye rockfish, being declared rebuilt by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm and are currently 100 fm as of 2021. The increased access to deeper depths south of Point Conception with the rebuilding of cowcod is expected to reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent. To the north of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are prevalent, depth constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area. As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected, which will likely further reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Prior to development of the live fish market in the 1980s, there was very little commercial catch of copper rockfish, with dead copper rockfish fetching a low ex-vessel price per pound. Copper rockfish were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as incidental catch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and, rarely, trawl gear. Trawling was prohibited within three miles of shore in 1953 and gill netting within three miles of shore was prohibited in 1994, preventing access to a high proportion of the species habitat with these gear types. Copper rockfish were caught along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as bycatch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for fish landed live arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market are lumped into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs.), with small, plate-sized, fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between \$5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery. The proportion of copper rockfish being landed live vs.~dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wilson-Vandenberg et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including the requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain copper rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date. The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The population of copper rockfish south of Point Conception to the U.S./Mexico border is assessed here as a separate stock (Figure \ref{fig:map}). This decision was made based on oceanographic conditions and previous assessments of copper rockfish. The stock split in California waters at Point Conception accounts for water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish population north and south of the area. An additional analysis is presented in the Appendix, Section \ref{man-area}, that summarized current research to inform of stock structure in copper rockfish off the West Coast and evaluated the available information to guide selection of the management area relative to the assessment area.

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes, split at 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' N. lat. off the West Coast. Each complex, comprised of nearshore rockfish species, is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catches) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex (North or South). Removals for species within the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complexes are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Table \ref{tab:ofl} shows the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complex level OFLs and ACLs, the copper rockfish OFL and ACL contributions amounts for both areas, the state-specific allocations of the copper rockfish ACL contribution (the south copper rockfish ACL plus 25 percent allocated to California from the north ACL), and the total removals for California, south of Point Conception.

The commercial removals were extracted from the The Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for 1981-2020 on February 21, 2021. Commercial removals for copper rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969 were extracted from the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, non-trawl, and unknown gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports north of Point Conception. To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS CALCOM) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-80 into CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1980 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for further details.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were extracted from the PacFIN database (extracted February 22, 2021). Landings were separated for the area south of Point Conception based on port of landing. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

Biological data were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System on February 21, 2001. Length data for the commercial fleet were extracted from the PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples for south of Point Conception beginning in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). The number of total lengths available was highly variable ranging from 2 to 542 samples per year. The samples prior to 1995 were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations these low sample years appeared to have a disproportionate impact on selectivity estimates and were therefore removed from the base model (treated as a `ghost' fleet, see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for implied fits to these lengths).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet were between approximately 25 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}), with relatively low observations of fish larger than 45 cm (detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}. The mean length observed by year ranged between 32 - 39 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The mean length across commercial lengths was the smallest in 2014 (around 32 cm) and has generally incrementally increased in the subsequent years.

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish. The recreational catches of copper rockfish south of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined in the 1990s and early 2000s. The removals remained relatively low until 2015 and after. The increase in removals in 2015 was likely due to new Annual Catch Limits being updated based on the 2013 assessment {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 and 1993 - 2003 were obtained from Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). MRFSS includes estimates of removals for 1980. However, due to inconsistencies in the estimates of this year in MRFSS, likely due to it being the first year of the survey with low sample sizes, the value for recreational removals from Ralston et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} was used.

The MRFSS definition of ``Southern California'' included San Luis Obispo County from 1981 - 1989, requiring the catches from this county to be split out and removed from the recreational removals south of Point Conception. Albin et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1993)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} used MRFSS data to estimate catch at a finer spatial scale from the California/Oregon border to the southern edge of San Luis Obispo County.

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus \emph{Sebastes} at fixed stations (e.g., sites, Figure \ref{fig:hkl-sites}) in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey are bocaccio (\emph{S. paucispinis}), cowcod (\emph{S. levis}), greenspotted (\emph{S. chlorostictus}), and vermilion/sunset (\emph{S. miniatus} and \emph{S. crocotulus}) rockfishes, although a wide range of rockfish species have been observed by this survey. During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the angler's discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish have been observed at multiple sampling sites by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey each year between 2004 - 2019 (Table \ref{tab:hkl-len}). Starting in 2014 the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA). Across all sample years and sample sites the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey has observed a total of 1,117 copper rockfish. Copper rockfish have been observed both outside and inside the CCA (Figures \ref{fig:hkl-site-ob} and \ref{fig:hkl-cca}). However, the limited number of copper rockfish observations within the CCA constrained the ability to determine whether the CCA impacted the frequency and or sizes observed compared to the other areas sampled (non-CCA sampling sites). Copper rockfish were observed at sites with depth ranging between 40 - 120 m with only the largest sizes being observed at the greatest depths (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-dep}).

Copper rockfish caught in the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey were generally between 30 and 50 cm for both sexes (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-len-data}).

While copper rockfish are not observed in large numbers similar to vermilion/sunset rockfish (N = 23,110), greenspotted rockfish (N = 4,432), or bocaccio (N = 16,519) in the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey, there are observations per year to support an index of abundance although it may be uncertain. An annual index of abundance was calculated from the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey data following the methods put Harms et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} based on the AIC criterion. The index of abundance was calculated using a binomial generalized-linear model. The final index includes year, site, number of hooks, fisher, drop number, and swell height as covariates. The single index of abundance was calculated using observations from both outside and within the CCA (Table \ref{tab:hkl-index-vals} and Figure \ref{fig:hkl-index}). Due to the limited number of copper rockfish observations within the CCA, calculating an index of abundance using only data collected outside the CCAs was similar in trend and variance to the index calculated when using all available data. The diagnostics for the binomial generalized-linear model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:hkl-diag}.

This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The \gls{s-wcgbt} uses trawl gear to sample sandy bottom areas off the West Coast and \emph{a priori} it would not be expected to be an informative data source for copper rockfish, which are closely associated with rock substrate. The \gls{s-wcgbt} had limited tows by year where copper rockfish were observed within this area, preventing the calculation of an index of abundance for copper rockfish. With limited length observations and in the absence of an index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This approach modifies work done by Then et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} who estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general.

This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and was supported by the observed ages that had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish south of Point Conception using data combined across multiple sources. Given variable oceangraphic conditions north and south of Point Conception, among other factors, differences in growth patterns in the same species among areas may occur. Ideally a full area-specific growth curve would be externally estimated by sex (parameters {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L2\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} within Stock Synthesis) based on a single age and growth study. However, given limitations in ageing capacity a targeted sampling approach was applied. The Cooperative Ageing Program (CAP) selected a subsample of larger (greater than 35 cm) of copper rockfish observed by both the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey and the \Gls{s-wcgbt} (Figure \ref{fig:survey-len-at-age-data}). These observations were combined with simulated data based on a published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Fishes sampled by Lea et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} study were for the most part collected off central California between July 1978 through December 1985. This study included numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish younger than 5 years of age (since data on individual fish were not reported). The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with data from older fish observed in the survey data sources (Figure \ref{fig:south-len-at-age-data}). This combined data set was used to calculate the growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. The length-at-age observations from the surveys show minimal differences to those collected off the Oregon and Washington coast from fishery-dependent sources (Figure \ref{fig:len-at-age-comp}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The calculated growth parameters used in this assessment indicated females and males have similar, if not identical, growth trajectories. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish.

Maturity-at-length was based on maturity reads conducted by Melissa Head at the NWFSC examining a total of 111 samples collected south of Point Conception by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey and \Gls{s-wcgbt}. The maturity-at-length curve is based on an estimate of functional maturity rather than biological maturity. Biological maturity can include multiple behaviors that functional will exclude (e.g., abortive maturation and skip spawning). Biological maturity indicates that some energy reserves were used to create vitellogenin, but it does not mean that eggs will continue to develop and successfully spawn. This includes juvenile abortive maturation. Female rockfish commonly go through the first stages of spawning the year before they reach actual spawning capability. This is most likely a factor related to their complicated reproductive process of releasing live young. A subset of oocytes will develop early yolk, and then get aborted during the spawning season. Biological maturity also does not account for the proportion of oocytes in atresia (cellular breakdown and reabsorption), which means that fish that were skipping spawning for the season could be listed as biologically mature and functionally immature (Melissa Head, personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA).

The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA), a data-moderate approach, which incorporated catch and index data with priors on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, split north and south of Point Conception.

A bridging analysis was conducted to replicate the results from XDB-SRA. XDB-SRA is a delay-difference model that uses a production function to define biomass and dynamics of a stock. XDB-SRA does not explicitly parameterize weight-at-length and length-at-age. The bridge Stock Synthesis model assumed a structure similar to XDB-SRA: single-sex, deterministic recruitment, and knife-edged selectivity equal to 50 percent maturity-at-length. The growth in the bridge Stock Synthesis model was based on the biological values provided in the 2013 assessment for copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, although the XDB-SRA does not explicitly define growth. The bridge model used the data from the XDB-SRA model: catches and indices, the median parameter values from XDB-SRA: depletion in the year 2000, natural mortality, and productivity (steepness). The bridge model used the 3-parameter Ricker-Power stock-recruitment function which can replicate the stock recruitment relationship with XDB-SRA.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The bridge model estimated a stock status time series that matched the estimate from XDB-SRA but estimated a reduced stock size across time compared to XDB-SRA (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-1}, red line). This mis-match in scale alone implied a difference in the implied growth (all mature biomass assumed equal) within XDB-SRA versus the weight-at-length parameterization for the bridge model. The female weight-at-length was adjusted within the bridge model to produce a stock trajectory that matched in scale the results from XDB-SRA (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-1} and \ref{fig:bridge-growth}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Once the matching bridge structure was identified, the parameterization of the model was updated in a step-wise fashion by the following steps:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remove the depletion "survey" for the year 2000.
    \item Update all biology to match those applied in the base model (natural mortality, length-weight, length-at-age, fecundity, and maturity).
    \item Switch to a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship with a steepness value of 0.72, the value in the base model.
    \item Update catches through 2012, lumped into a single fleet.
    \item Add all lengths to the model through 2012, lumped into a single fleet. Allow for asymptotic selectivity estimation using the double normal selectivity parameterization. 
    \item Remove the indices of abundance used in the 2013 XDB-SRA model.
    \item Add in the NWFSC Hook and Line Suvey index of abundance, length data, and fleet specific selectivity curve.
    \item Separate catches and lengths into the fleet structure assumed in the base model. Allow for fleet-specific selectivity estimation.  
    \item Turn on annual recruitment deviations.
\end{enumerate}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Removing the depletion ``survey'' resulted in a shift upward in scale and stock status in 2013 (Figures \ref{fig:bridge-ssb} and \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). Updating the biology included changing the length-weight, length-at-age, maturity, and transitioning the fecundity assumption from being equal to spawning biomass to being in terms of eggs and body size (spawning output). Figure \ref{fig:bridge-ssb-2} shows only the time series in terms of spawning output for ease of visibility. The comparable quantity, stock status, was more pessimistic relative to the 2013 XDB-SRA model (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). All subsequent changes or additions to the 2013 model resulted in a more pessimistic view of the stock (Figure \ref{fig:bridge-depl}). The largest changes resulted when the length composition data was added and the 2013 fishery-dependent indices removed. The fishery-dependent indices used in the 2013 copper rockfish south model were variable but had a slight increasing trend (see Figure 69 in Cope et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The length data from the recreational fishery, the main source of removals, has limited observation of larger copper rockfish, with the peak of the length data distribution around 30 cm. The observed length distribution combined with an asymptotic selectivity assumption resulted in a highly pessimistic estimate of stock status.

The bridge model was modified from this point to determine the base model by extending the catches, extending fishery and survey lengths to 2020, adding a survey fleet for the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey with an index of abundance and length compositions, and updating and/or changing model assumptions based upon fits to the data.

Copper rockfish south of Point Conception were assessed using a two-sex model with sex-specific life history parameters. The model assumed two fishing fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in 1916 and one survey fleet, the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey. Selectivity was specified for all fleets in the model using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis. The selectivity for the commercial and recreational fleets were allowed to estimate dome-shaped selectivity and the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic.

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 50 years. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1} and a standard error of 0.438.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard error of 0.15. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA), which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

The base model was weighted using the ``Francis method'', which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, the mean of the prior. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1} for females and males, the median of the prior. Annual recruitment was deterministic predicted from the stock-recruitment curve. Growth, maturity-at-length, and length-at-weight was fixed as described above in Section \ref{bio-data}. Likelihood profiles were conducted across steepness, natural mortality, and growth parameters to examine the impact of the selected fixed values in the model.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older copper rockfish are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. After explorations, the commercial and recreational fleets were both allowed to estimate dome-shaped selectivity due to extreme model estimates (highly pessimistic) when forced to be asymptotic. Selectivity for both fleets used a double normal selectivity parameterization where the ascending width, the size at peak, and the final selectivity parameters estimated in the base model. Estimating the descending width was explored during model explorations and was fixed in the base model based on these explorations.

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was estimated at 5.5. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity for both the commercial and recreational fleets were estimated to be dome-shaped, with reduced selectivity for larger copper rockfish. However, a dome-shaped selectivity was not anticipated \emph{a priori} but forcing one or both of the fleets to have asymptotic selectivity resulted in an extremely depleted stock status (\textasciitilde3 percent when both fleets assumed asymptotic selectivity). The highly pessimistic stock status was deemed to have limited plausibility given the ongoing high removals of copper rockfish in recent years. Multiple sensitivities were performed to examine the assumption of dome-shaped selectivity in the base model (see Section \ref{sensitivities}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The commercial fleet selectivity peaked at 35.5 cm and decreased to low selectivity rates for larger copper rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:selex}). The recreational fleet selectivity peaked at smaller sizes relative to the commercial fleet with full selectivity occurring at 29.6 cm. The esimated peak selectivities for the commercial and recreational fleets were less than the length-at-50 percent maturity (34.3 cm).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey was fixed to have asymptotic selectivity with selectivity peaking at 38.5 cm (Figure \ref{fig:selex}). The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey selectivity is markedly different compared to the commercial and recreational fleets. This difference was speculated to be due to two factors: 1) the survey sampling deeper waters that, until recently, the recreational fishery did not have access to where larger copper rockfish are commonly found, and 2) many of the observations of large copper rockfish by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey were around areas that would likely require at least a 3/4 day trip (i.e., Santa Rosa Island, San Miguel Island) which would put them out of range of the more typical 1/2 day trip recreational fishing efforts (John Harms, personal communication, NOAA, NWFSC).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. Annual recruitment deviations were not estimated in the base model due to confounding between recent high catches, estimated low stock abundance, and recruitment deviations. A rise in catches could be related to above average recruitment. However, when recruitment deviations were allowed to be estimated, the estimates of annual recruitment deviations were positively biased in recent years presumably for the model to maintain the population biomass greater than 0 (not extinct). This issue was identified by conducting a 20 year retrospective analysis combined with a plot that reflects the model estimated recruitment strength by year as data were removed. When all data were removed that would inform recent recruitment, the recruitment deviations did not decline to 0, but remained positive (Figure \ref{fig:squid-rec}). Based on this, recruitment deviations were not estimated in the base model. The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. Annual recruitment estimated directly from the stock-recruitment curve are shown in Figure \ref{fig:recruits}.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery length data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}. There are limited patterns in the Pearson residuals but there is potential evidence of an above average recruitment moving through the population in recent years. The mean length observed by year from the commercial fleet were uncertain but with a relatively stable mean size until 2014 when the mean length declined and then slowly increase in the subsequent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, observations greater than expected, for larger fish prior to 2000. Adding a block in selectivity for this period was explored during model development but there was little support in the data for the added model complexity (i.e., similar fits to the data). In recent years, there are residual patterns in the length data that likely indicate above average recruitments moving through the population age structure, which the model was unable to capture with deterministic recruitment. The mean length in the early period of data ranged between 28 - 38 cm, with a decline and stabilizing of the mean observed length in recent years around 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey were variable by year and by sex (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-pearson}). Similar to the other data sources in the model there appears to be a pattern of observations greater than the model expectations moving through the population possibly supporting an above average recruitment event prior to 2011 and 2013. The mean length observed by year from the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey varied by year ranging between 35 - 40 cm (Figure \ref{fig:hkl-mean-len-fit}).

The fit to the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey index of abundance is shown in Figure \ref{fig:index-fit}. The index of abundance was relatively flat between 2004 - 2009, dropped in 2010, and then slowly increases until 2015. The model was unable to capture these trends in the index of abundance and estimated a slightly increasing stock until 2013 and then declining in the final years. The index of abundance had relatively high uncertainty intervals (uncertainty estimated in the index development) by years likely due to the limited observations of copper rockfish in the survey. In order to fit the index of abundance the base model estimated added variance (0.2) which is reflected by the thin bars on Figure \ref{fig:index-fit}. The catchability calculated for the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey was \ensuremath{6.14\times 10^{-5}}. Multiple sensitivities (e.g., selectivity shape, no added variance, upweighting the index while downweighting other data sources, estimating annual recruitment deviations) were conducted attempting to produce a better fit to the index of abundance. The only sensitivity that was identified to improve the fit to the index of abundance was estimating annual recruitment deviations. However, adding annual recruitment deviations to the base model was not done due to correlations between recent high catches and recruitment estimates.

The estimated spawning output decreases sharply in the mid-1970s reaching a low around 2000. The spawning output slowly increases between 2000 - 2013 and then begins declining in recent years due to an increase in removals starting in 2013.

A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided with reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Tables \ref{tab:sensitivities-1} and \ref{tab:sensitivities-2}.

The majority of sensitivities estimated the final stock status to be below the management threshold limit of 25 percent of unfished spawning output, similar to the base model. Estimating annual recruitment deviations from the stock recruitment curve resulted in a more pessimistic final stock status relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}).

Along the coast of California, over the last couple of decades, several marine protected areas that prohibited retention have been created (see Appendix Section \ref{ca-closed-open}). During model development there was much discussion concerning the model results and whether they reflected the copper rockfish population south of Point Conception as a whole or only reflect the status of the stock in fished areas. In order to understand how the results could possibly vary if a portion of the population was protected from fishing, some simple area-based sensitivities were conducted. These sensitivities make some strong and generous assumptions that do not match the real world system. The first major assumption is that the protected areas have experienced no fishing pressure across all model years (known to not match the true implementation of protected areas). The second assumption is that annual recruitment by year is pooled across both protected and fished areas with the proportion of recruitment settling to each area equal to the area protected (e.g., if 20 percent of the population is protected then 20 percent of annual recruitment settles in that area). Three sensitivities were conducted where the percent of protected area was either 10, 15, or 20 percent of the total population.

Values of log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) lower than 5.25 resulted in a crashed population and were not explored further.

For steepness, values from approximately 0.50 to 0.80 were supported by the negative log-likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). The information content in the length data by source was variable, with the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey data supporting higher steepness values and the commercial and recreational fleets supporting lower values. Assuming higher steepness values estimated lower initial spawning output and a lower stock status relative to the base model where values greater than 0.85 resulted in a crashed population (Figures \ref{fig:h-ssb} and \ref{fig:h-depl}).

This approach assumes asymptotic selectivity and deterministic recruitment to produce independent estimates by year of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort based on the observed recreational lengths. This analysis indicated the copper rockfish were 50 percent selected size around 25 cm with full selection between 31 - 32 cm (Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). For comparison, the size at 50 percent length-at-maturity was fixed at 34.3 cm south of Point Conception based on the maturity curve developed for this assessment. The LB-SPR estimate of the size at 50 percent selection assuming asymptotic selectivity was consistent with the base model estimates which estimated the peak of selectivity (although allowed to be domed) at sizes less than 50 percent maturity (Figure \ref{fig:selex}).

Copper rockfish is assessed as four distinct stocks off the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California; north of Point Conception in California; Oregon; and Washington. The area north of Point Conception off the coast of California was estimated to have the largest unfished spawning output of copper rockfish off the West Coast. The stocks off of the Oregon and Washington coast are smaller in size compared to the California stocks, with the stock off the coast of Washington estimated to have the smallest unfished spawning output. Comparison of the estimated spawning output trajectories for the California stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-ca-compare} with Oregon and Washington shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-orwa-compare}. The fraction unfished across all West Coast stocks shown in Figure \ref{fig:depl-compare}. The California stocks are estimated to be the most depleted, with the stock south of Point Conception estimated below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished and the stock north of Point Conception estimated to be in the precautionary zone (less than the management target of 40 percent but above the management threshold). The stock off the coast of Washington is estimated to be just above the management target and the Oregon stock well above the target.

The estimated spawning output from the previous assessment conducted in 2013 and the base model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:compare-ssb-2013} and the estimated fraction unfished are shown in Figure \ref{fig:compare-depl-2013}. The scale of the stock is substantially lower compared to the 2013 assessment. This is due to both a change in units from spawning biomass (2013) to spawning output in terms of millions of eggs (2021) and from changes in length-at-age and weight-at-length parameters (not explicitly defined in 2013). The base model has a significantly more pessimistic view of the relative stock status compared to the 2013 assessment, with the base model estimating that the stock has been below the minimum stock biomass threshold for the majority of years since the early 1980s (the stock was above the threshold briefly between 2011 - 2015).

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output, 18.1 percent, is below the management threshold limit of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-\text{SPR}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has been above the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) in recent years, except 2020 when overall removals declined due to impacts of COVID-19 which reduced recreational fishing effort (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}).

There were some major sources of uncertainty within this assessment. To improve our understanding of the copper rockfish stock south of Point Conception the following research and data collection should be prioritized:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The commercial and recreational fisheries had limited observations of larger copper rockfish.  It is unclear whether this was due to lack of access to larger individuals or a truncation of the length/age distribution due to fishing effort. Fishery-independent survey information collected by either hook and line or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) targeting areas that are subject to recreational and commercial fishing could improve our understanding the availability of copper rockfish.

    \item The assessment area appears to have a mixture of observations from areas experiencing variable fishing mortality. In the region there are likely a mixture of areas: open access rocky reefs that are close to port that are heavily fished, open access rocky reefs that are inaccessible via day-trips that are fished but likely lower levels, and rocky reefs that fall within marine protect areas.  A spatially-explicit assessment model may be able to capture this complexity but will require data (indices of abundance and composition data) from each of the regions. 

    \item There are very limited age data for copper rockfish south of Point Conception. The NWFSC Hook and Line Survey was the main source of otoliths read for constructing a age-at-length curve for copper rockfish. Collection otoliths from the recreational fishery, a large source of mortality in the area, would support future assessments  and would improve the understanding of the population structure and life history of copper rockfish. 

    \item California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) provided additional length observation data that were not available for use in the base model reviewed in the June 2021 Groundfish Subcommittee meeting of the Scientific and Statistical Committee (GFSC-SSC).  These data were collected from the recreational fishery commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFV; aka 'party' and 'charter') between the 1970s - 1990s. A total of 3,499 additional length observations collected between 1975 - 1989 were provided for the area south of Point Conception. A model sensitivity was performed looking at the inclusion of these data which showed that they only had a minimal impact on the base model. However, these data should be provided and included in future assessments of copper rockfish.  Additionally, it was noted during the GFSC meeting that there are additional lengths in these data sets that were not included in the sensitvities due to early copper rockfish samples being recorded as 'whitebelly rockfish' that should also be considered in future assessments.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

At present, stock assessments reliant on fishery-dependent data only represent the areas open to fishing, unless there is a fishery-independent data source providing information on the relative abundance and length composition in closed areas. A network of marine protected areas (MPAs) was established between 2003 to 2012 through a regional siting process. The length composition and relative abundance inside and outside MPAs in part results from the presence of MPAs prohibiting take of groundfish established prior to expansion of the current network, duration of existence of new areas, degree of effort prior to protection and criteria for selection focusing on high productivity reefs. These areas are established in perpetuity and will provide substantial protections to nearshore fish stocks for the foreseeable future.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In addition to MPAs, extensive Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) of varying depths over time and space, as well as the two cowcod conservation areas (CCAs) encompassing 4200 square miles of water area since 2001, were established to facilitate rebuilding of overfished species. While the depth restrictions in these closed areas can change or be eliminated, the areas closed become refugia that reduce fishing mortality, allowing accumulation of biomass within them. There has long been interest in quantifying the area of reef habitat for each assessed species that resides in protected areas, but until very recently, there was insufficient data on the distribution of rocky reef habitat. This analysis provides the percentage of habitat area for copper and quillback rockfish closed to fishing in MPAs, RCAs and CCAs where the take of groundfish was prohibited in each year from 2001 to 2021.

A predictive substrate layer that identifies hard and soft substrate was used to analyze seafloor coverage within the 3 nautical miles from California's shore. Substrate types were generated algorithmically using rugosity analysis, to identify areas likely to have rocky reefs. This layer was derived from bathymetric data of 2, 5 and 10 m resolution and bathymetric data were collected by California Seafloor Mapping Project (CSMP). Potential issues with this rugosity analysis include noise and artifacts resulting from unusual substrate structure, original mapping data, and steep slopes. In addition, hard substrate might be underestimated in areas with canyon slopes, deep water, over smooth rock and where sediments cover rock.

Data from the CSMP is known to have nearshore data gaps referred to as the white zone. Contributors from The University of California Santa Cruz, California Ocean Science Trust, and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conducted a 30 m resolution interpolation analysis to estimate hard and soft substrate within the white zone. The interpolation analysis utilized data from the CSMP and National Oceanic and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI). Accuracy of the interpolation is estimated to be best where the white zone bands are narrowest and worst where the white zone bands are widest. In addition, metadata indicates the interpolation is questionable at scales finer than 100 m.

Substrate data developed for an Essential Fish Habitat Review was incorporated into this analysis for seafloor occurring outside of California State Waters (3 nautical miles). This dataset was generated by Joe Bizarro of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Santa Cruz and was created by combining multiple sources of bathymetric data with varying resolutions including multibeam sonar, sidescan sonar, sediment grabs, core samples seismic reflection profiles, still photos and video. This habitat data are subject to georeferencing errors and data resolution errors. Currently, this is the best available data that represents hard and soft substrate types offshore for the areas outside of California State waters.

Regulation histories for each type of closure were converted to Boolean fields with zeros and ones indicating absence and implementation, respectively from 2001-2020. The corresponding GIS layers were either available from previous CDFW GIS staff projects or approximated by the depth contour where specific weigh points were unavailable. The area in MPAs prohibiting take by the recreational and commercial fisheries were included in the estimates of area closed to fishing from the first year in which the MPA was in place for a full calendar year. The Western CCA area accounted for waters around islands and banks open to take of a limited suite of groundfish species including copper rockfish. The RCAs for commercial and recreational fisheries were based on the deeper of the depth restrictions for the sectors to reflect only areas where take was prohibited for both. Where the RCA lines for the stock in question were not available, depth contours were used to approximate the percent of area closed.

The distribution and area of rocky reef habitat within a species range was delineated in ArcGIS Pro (2.6) by extracting specific values from a 10 m bathymetric raster based on species depth and latitudinal ranges. The resulting raster layer was converted into a shapefile and merged with a coastal boundary of California to account for gaps in the bathymetric raster. Hard habitat within the species range was identified and isolated using the intersect tool to create species range shapefile. This process was repeated to identify overlapping coverage between the species range and hard substrate, as well as intersecting the species range with a combination of different types of regulatory boundaries.

The areas of the resulting shapefiles were calculated in GIS and exported into tables using Python script. The combination of area closures in a given year were overlayed on the habitat maps, with the area in MPAs and CCAs extracted first, then the habitat in the remaining RCAs estimated. The residual habitat still open to fishing after accounting for the closed areas was then estimated. The area of rocky reef habitat closed to fishing within a species range was converted to a percentage of the total habitat. This process for identifying overlapping boundaries and calculating areas were scripted in Python to reduce the possibility of human error.

Current assessments do not account for length/age composition and differing fishing mortality rates inside and outside MPAs or waters in long-established CCAs and RCAs. As biomass accrues inside these areas, accounting for protections through area-based assessment methods or effects on selectivity should be considered as fishery dependent data will only reflect the length composition and density outside. There is the potential for future assessments to account for differences in length composition, fishing mortality and relative abundance in a two-area model in Stock Synthesis with available data from long-term MPA monitoring.

Additional high resolution side scan sonar data in waters seaward of the CSMP coverage would improve coverage and resolution of habitat data. Similar analyses for each nearshore or shallower distributed shelf rockfish species (i.e., vermilion rockfish) would be a helpful addition to stock assessments to inform time blocking and selectivity considerations. The extent and design of the network to function in this way is unique to California and it's efforts to conserve nearshore stocks. Until the closed areas can be accounted for explicitly in stock assessments, the substantial areas in MPAs should be taken into consideration as a buffer against overfishing, since they were established in the interest of preserving spawning stock to seed areas outside and other MPAs in the network.

From 2013-2015, the CDFW in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE), conducted Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) surveys along the full length of the California coastline inside MPAs and in reference sites outside for comparison. Density estimates were produced from the ratio of observed fish per unit area observed over the area of seafloor observed by the ROV in fish per meter squared. The percent relative density reflecting the proportion of the density observed in each depth bin was estimated relative to the sum of the density values in observed depths. A particular advantage of ROV data compared to other data sources is the accuracy of the depth of encounter of individual fish, providing useful information regarding selectivity of fishing gear relative to the depth distribution of fish observed by the ROV.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In addition, length frequency distributions by depth were determined from fish observed by the ROV based on visual approximations using the distance between paired lasers. While future efforts to increase the precision of length estimates include using stereo-camera data and programs estimating length from trigonometric calculations, the trends in approximate length distribution with depth still provides useful information. Length frequency distributions for copper rockfish sampled by the ROV in reference locations open to fishing south of Point Conception show the majority of observations occurring between 10 - 20 fathoms with peak observations between 20 - 40 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rov-open}). The observations in closed areas, marine protected areas where retention is prohibited, had higher number of observations of copper rockfish across sizes and depths (Figure \ref{fig:rov-mpa}). Smaller sizes were observed in higher proportions across depth in open areas (Figure \ref{fig:rov-percent-open}) versus closed areas (Figure \ref{fig:rov-percent-mpa}).

The separate models for the areas south and north of Point Conception estimated two distinct stock trajectories with the stock in the north over recent years from low levels to at or around the management target and the stock in the south increasing from low levels between 2001 - 2014 and decreasing in recent years to levels below the minimum stock size threshold. The model for the area south of Point Conception did not estimate annual recruitment deviations which could contribute to stock trajectory differences to the stock to the north where strong recent recruitments have led to increases in stock size. However, in the model sensitivity for the south of Point Conception model that estimated annual recruitment deviations the stock trajectory remaining low (below the minimum stock size threshold) and did not show similar stock increases as observed in the north.

The areas of true population variation in relative stock size may not align with the assessment boundaries as currently defined. State based management is likely not the only factor impacting relative stock sizes across the coast where movement and recruitment patterns likely also influence potential differences in relative stock size.

Berger et al. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}: Aligning management assessment areas with with underlying population structure and processes is important, especially when fishing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogeneous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments compared to assessments that cover a subset of a population segment, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between population segments. Caveat: The variation is growth and connectivity between areas via recruitment for copper rockfish off the West Coast is currently unknown or uncertain.

Rather than creating separate assessments to account for variation in exploitation or life-history variation across areas a more integrated approach could be to apply a spatial assessment that can provide both area- and coastwide population estimates. However, spatial assessments come at the cost of a larger number of parameters to estimate, but general guidance around the key decisions exists when moving to spatial assessments (Punt {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). This approach should be evaluated to understand the trade-offs between adding parameters that may be poorly informed (e.g., movement, recruitment by area) via a spatial assessment approach versus either conducting separate assessments or applying the ``fleets-as-areas'' approach.
