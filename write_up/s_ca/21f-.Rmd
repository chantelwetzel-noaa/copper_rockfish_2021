## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

#### Landings

The commercial removals for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Commercial landings prior to 1969 were pulled from the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports north of Point Conception. To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010], and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-80 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1980 for all port complexes.  See Appendix A of Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for further details.
 
Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database (extracted February 22, 2021). Landings were separated for the area south of Point Conception based on port of landing. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards.  Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on WCGOP data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent. 

#### Length Compositions

Length data for the commercial fleet were pulled from PacFIN Biological Data System (BDS) with samples for south of Point Conception beginning in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). The number of total lengths available was highly variable ranging from 2 to 542 samples per year. The samples prior to 1995 were sparse and variable across sizes. During model explorations these low sample years appeared to have a disproportionate impact on selectivity estimates and these samples were therefore removed from the base model (treated as a 'ghost' fleet, see [Appendix A](#append_a) for implied fits to these lengths). 

The majority of lengths observed by the commercial fleet were between approximately 25 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}) with relatively low observations of fish larger than 45 cm (detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}. The mean length observed by year ranged between 32 - 39 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The mean length across commercial lengths was the smallest in 2014 (around 32 cm) and has generally incrementally in the subsequent years.

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Recreational Fishery

#### Landings

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 [@ralston_documentation_2010] which were available split north and south of Point Conception. Mortality estimates from 1981 to 2003 from the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS) were downloaded from the Recreational Fisheries Information Network (RecFIN).  The California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS) provided estimates from 2004 to 2020, downloaded from RecFIN.  Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish.  The missing years in the MRFSS perior, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. For years prior to 1981, a historical discard rate of 3 percent was assumed based on Miller and Gotshall [-@miller_ocean_1965].

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of `r spp`. The recreational catches of `r spp` south of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined in the 1990s and early 2000s.  The removals remained relatively low until 2015 and after.  The increase in removals in 2015 was likely due to new Annual Catch Limits being updated based on the 2013 assessment [@cope_data-moderate_2013].  

#### Length Compositions

Length data for retained catch from MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2020) were downloaded from the RecFIN website.  The lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020 were downloaded from the RecFIN website. Recreational length data was available starting in 1983 (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}). The total length samples per year was relatively low until 2004, the first year with 200+ samples, and increased substantially starting in 2012. The length data from the recreational fleet generally ranged between 25 to approximately 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}) with limited observations of fish greater than 45 cm. The annual mean length observed was relatively stable between 2004 and 2011, followed by a minor dip in mean size and slight increase in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}). Detailed length compositions by year can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-data}.

The input sample sizes for the recreational length data were set equal to the number of length samples available by year.
