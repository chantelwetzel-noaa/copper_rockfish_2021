## Rebuilding reference points

All reference points calculated based on this rebuilding analysis are given in Table \ref{tab:ref-points}. The minimum time required for rebuilding, $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$, with no fishing (F=0) starting in 2023 was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$tmin` years, corresponding to the stock being rebuilt by `r reb[[1]]$recovery[4] + reb[[1]]$tmin `, assuming the default removals for 2021 and 2022.  The mean generation time was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$mean_gen ` years. The maximum time allowed for rebuilding, $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ is defined as the $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ plus the mean generation time for stocks that are unable to rebuild in less than 10 years.  The minimum rebuilding time for `r spp` was `r reb[[1]]$tmin` years, just above the cut-off of less than 10 years, so  $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ was set to `r reb[[1]]$tmax `. 

## Alternative harvest projections

$\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ and $\text{SPR}_\text{TARGET}$ are not specified since this is the first rebuilding plan for `r spp` and these values have not been set via the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) process. A rebuilding strategy is presented below based on rebuilding target year termed $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ which is set at `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,1]`, mid-value between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$, along with the associated SPR harvest rate. The Council may opt to select a $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ earlier or later than this $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ value based on fishery, economic, or other factors.

Summary results from the rebuilding alternatives assuming removals of `r reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2]` and `r reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[2,2]` mt are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options}. Rebuilding alternatives based on various target years are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options-year}. Excluding the ABC Rule rebuilding strategy, the target rebuilding year based on the range of pre-specified SPR values between 0.55 - 0.75 ranged from 2036 - 2046 (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}). The probability of rebuilding by year steadily increased across the alternative SPR values with full rebuilding by 2046 when the lowest SPR of 0.55 was applied (Table \ref{tab:prob-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:prob-fig}). The recommended removals in 2023, the first year of rebuilding, were low ranging between `r min(round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,2:6],2))` - `r max(round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,2:6],2))` mt across alternative SPR values (Table \ref{tab:acl-mat}) with the recommended removals slowly increasing by year during the rebuilding period (Figure \ref{fig:acl-fig}). The estimated ABCs for each rebuilding alternative is given in Table \ref{tab:ofl-mat}. The change in spawning output by year relative to the spawning output target, 40 percent of unfished, under each of the alternative SPR values are shown by year in Table \ref{tab:rel-ssb-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:rel-ssb-fig}.

The ABC Rule projections were based on the adopted rockfish SPR target of 0.50 combined with a time-varying category 2 $\sigma$ and $P^*$ of 0.45.  Under the ABC Rule catches the stock was estimated to rebuild by year `r reb[[4]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget[9]` with a probability of `r reb[[4]]$rebuild_quants$Prebuild[9]` of the stock being rebuilt by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}). Rebuilding by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$, `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,1]`, was achieved using a SPR value of `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,2]` with a `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,3]` probability of rebuilding by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ `r reb[[1]]$tmax` (`r reb[[1]]$tmax`, Table \ref{tab:reb-options}). 

Alternative rebuilding analysis that examined a range of specific rebuilding target years generally fell within alternatives explored in the initial analysis (Table \ref{tab:reb-options-year} versus Table \ref{tab:reb-options}) but provided additional granularity to see potential rebuilding timelines.  The probability of rebuilding, median annual catches, median ABCs, and spawning output relative to the spawning output target (40 percent) by year are shown in Tables \ref{tab:prob-mat-year} - \ref{tab:rel-ssb-mat-year}.
