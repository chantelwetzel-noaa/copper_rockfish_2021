Summary results from the rebuilding alternatives assuming removals of `r reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2]` and `r reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[2,2]` mt are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options}. Summaries of the additional alternative based on reduced removals in 2021 and 2022 are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options-catch} and rebuilding alternatives based on various target years are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options-year}.

The target rebuilding year based on the range of pre-specified SPR values between 0.55 - 0.75 ranged from 2036 - 2046 (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}). The probability of rebuilding by year steadily increased across the alternative SPR values with full rebuilding by 2046 when the lowest SPR of 0.55 was applied (Table \ref{tab:prob-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:prob-fig}). The recommended removals in 2023, the first year of rebuilding, were low ranging between `r min(round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,2:6],2))` - `r max(round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,2:6],2))` mt across alternative SPR values (Table \ref{tab:acl-mat}) with the recommended removals slowly increasing by year during the rebuilding period (Figure \ref{fig:acl-fig}). The change in spawning output by year under each of the alternative SPR values are shown by year in Table \ref{tab:ssb-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:ssb-fig}).

The "ABC Rule" projections were based on the adopted rockfish SPR target of 0.50 combined with a time-varying $\sigma$ and category 2 $P^*$.  The stock was estimated to rebuild by year `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget[9]` with a probability of `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants$Prebuild[9]` (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}). Rebuilding by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$, `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,1]`, was achieved using a SPR value of `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,2]` (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}) with a `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,3]` probability of rebuilding by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$, `r reb[[1]]$tmax` (Table \ref{tab:prob-mat}). 

Reducing the assumed removals in 2021 and 2022 had only a limited impact on the estimated rebuilding by SPR rate (Table \ref{tab:reb-options-catch}). Reducing the removals in 2021 and 2022 decreased the minimum time for rebuilding ($\text{T}_\text{MIN}$) to `r reb[[2]]$recovery_spec[4] + reb[[2]]$tmin `, two years earlier compared to the initial rebuilding alternatives.  The reduction of the $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ resulted in a decrease in the $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ to `r reb[[2]]$tmax`. The probability of rebuilding, ACLs, and spawning outputs by year are shown in Tables \ref{tab:prob-mat-catch} - \ref{tab:ssb-mat-catch}. 

The final alternative rebuilding analysis that examined a range of specific rebuilding target years (Table \ref{tab:reb-options-year}) generally fell within alternatives explored in the initial analysis (Table \ref{tab:reb-options}) but provided additional granularity to see potential rebuilding timelines.  The probability of rebuilding, ACLs, and spawning output by year are shown in Tables \ref{tab:prob-mat-year} - \ref{tab:ssb-mat-year}
