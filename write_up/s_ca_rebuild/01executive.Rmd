# Summary{-}

This rebuilding analysis is for the stock of `r spp` (_Sebastes caurinus_) in waters off California, south of Point Conception. The analysis is based on the 2021 stock assessment. The 2021 assessment model estimated the `r spp` south of Point Conception to be at 18% of the unexploited equilibrium spawning output at the beginning of 2021. This rebuilding analysis compares the results of applying a suite of potential management actions to the stock for 2023 and beyond.

The results of the analysis show that the value for $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$, the median year for rebuilding to the target level in the absence of fishing since the year of declaration (2021), is XX. The estimated generation time for `r spp` was estimated to be XX. In conjunction with $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and the mean generation time $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ to be XX. The SPR = XX% harvest rate generates a 50% probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$.
