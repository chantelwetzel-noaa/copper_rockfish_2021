# Introduction

The 2021 assessment of `r spp` south of Point Conception documented that the stock had declined below the minimum stock size  (MSST) 25%, for the first time during the mid 1980s, increased above the MSST briefly between 2010-2016, but had fallen back below the MSST starting in 2017 (ADD REFERENCE). Given the assumed productivity of stock combined with the longevity of `r spp` a range of alternative rebuilding approaches were examined with rebuilding ranging from `r reb[[1]]$recovery_spec[4] + reb[[1]]$tmin ` to `r reb[[1]]$tmax ` based on various harvest rates from `r round(min(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[,2]),2) ` to `r round(max(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[,2]),2) `


# Overview of the 2021 stock assessment

The 2021 assessment of `r spp` assessed the stock as four separate sub-stocks along the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California, north of Point Conception in California, Oregon, and Washington.  This was the first assessment of `r spp` that used composition data, length data, to inform model estimates around stock size and status where the previous assessment conducted in 2013 used only catch and catch-per-unit-effort data.  The model for the area south of Point Conception in California was modeled as two fleets, commercial and recreational, along with one survey fleet, the Northwest Fisheries Science Center Hook and Line Survey. The majority of the removals and length composition data arose from the recreational fleet. Total removals of `r spp` peaked around 1980 and had increased in recent years from lows in the early 2000s.  The stock was modeled using Stock Synthisis as a two-sex model. Area specific length-at-age and fecundity-at-length for the area south of Point Conception were estimated externally and were fixed within the model. Natural mortality and steepness were both fixed a the median or mean of the priors. The selectivity of both the commercial and recreational fishery were estimated to be domed-shape with the survey selectivity fixed to be asymptotic. 


# Management performance under rebuilding

This is the first rebuilding plan for `r spp ` off the coast of California south of Point Conception.
