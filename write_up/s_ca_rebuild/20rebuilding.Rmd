# Rebuilding calculations

This rebuilding analysis was conducted using software developed by A. Punt (version 3.12h, August 2021). The steps followed were: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define how equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) will be calculated. 
	\item Define how future recruitment will be generated. 
	\item Define the fishery selectivity and allocation to be applied during rebuilding. 
	\item Decide how to include uncertainty in input parameters from the stock assessment in the rebuilding analysis. 
	\item Calculate rebuilding reference points from the most current assessment results 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Calculate the projected year in which the stock would rebuild with a 50$\%$ probability if all future fishing mortality was eliminated ($\text{T}_\text{F}$=0).
		\item  Calculate the projected year for a 50$\%$ probability of rebuilding from the year in which the stock was first declared overfished ($\text{T}_\text{MIN}$). 
		\item Calculate the mean generation time. 
		\item Calculate the maximum allowable rebuilding time ($\text{T}_\text{MAX}$). 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Identification and analysis of alternative harvest strategies for rebuilding. 
\end{itemize}

## Definition of Equilibrium Spawning Output

The equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) used in this rebuilding analysis is calculated via the stock-recruitment relationship in order to be consistent with assessment model results. This level was estimated to be `r round(reb[[1]]$sb0,2)` millions of eggs in the base case assessment model, which dictates a rebuilding relative spawning output target ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) of `r round(reb[[1]]$sb40,2)` millions of eggs (Table \ref{tab:ref-points}). 

## Generation of future recruitment

The estimated parameters of the stock recruitment relationship (unexploited equilibrium recruitment [natural log of $R_0$], and steepness [$h$]) were used to generate future recruitments in the rebuilding analysis.  The 2021 assessment model did not estimate annual recruitment deviations but uncertainty around future recruitments was generated by assuming a recruitment variability of $\sigma_R = 0.60$.

## Population biology, fishery selectivity, and removal allocations

The biological parameters used for the rebuilding projections were based on the values from the Stock Synthesis assessment model. Biological parameters in the assessment were sex-specific and constant across time.  

The selectivity used in the rebuilding analysis were obtained from 2021 assessment. Selectivity in the assesment model was constant across time for each fishing fleet. The relative allocation of catch among fleets in this rebuilding analysis was informed using the relative fishing mortality averaged over recent years (2015-2019).

## Inclusion of uncertainty

Uncertainty was included in this rebuilding analysis via 1,200 random simulations of stochastic future recruitment strengths and integration over the three states of nature across stock size, log($R_0$). The base model was given 50% of the weight and each alternative state of nature was given 25% of the weight. 


## Alternate rebuilding strategies analyzed

Assuming that a constant rate of harvest will be applied throughout a rebuilding period, the basis for rebuilding alternatives can be divided into two approaches: 1) strategies based on selection of a constant harvest rate (SPR rate), or 2) strategies based selection of a $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ (year for 50% probability of recovery). This rebuilding analysis presents the following alternate strategies spread among the approaches based on the selection of a SPR harvest rate or rebuilding by a selected target year:  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply a range of SPR values: 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, and 0.75 
	\item Eliminate all harvest, F = 0, beginning in the next management cycle, 2023, the same as setting a constant SPR harvest rate of 1.0.
	\item Apply the ACL based on the 40:10 harvest control rule.
	\item Apply the ABC with time-varying $\sigma$.
	\item Apply SPR harvest rates that are estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by alternative target years: $\text{T}_\text{MID}$, $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$, and other years between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$
\end{itemize}

All of the above rebuilding strategies were conducted assuming removals of `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2],2)` mt and `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[2,2],2)` mt in 2021 and 2022. A sensitivity examining the impact of reducing removals in 2021 and 2022 to 50 mt was conducted on a subset of the alternative fixed SPR harvest rate alternative listed above.
