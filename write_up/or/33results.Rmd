## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The model estimated 113 total parameters: $R_0$, 6 selectivity parameters, and 106 parameters for annual recruitment deviations.  The $R_0$ was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic for the commercial fleet with a peak in maximum selectivity for fish at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_OR_Commercial(1)', 'Value'], 1)` cm.  The selectivity for the recreational fleet was estimated to be dome-shaped at the largest sizes.  The peak of the selectivity curve by the recreational fleet was estimated to be `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_OR_Recreational(2)', 'Value'], 1)` cm. Sensitivities to the shape of the recreational selectivity was explored (see [Sensitivies](#sensitivites) for details). 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The Person residuals for the commercial fishery have no discernable pattern of misfit to the length data (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The largest residual was observed in 2017 for male fish where there was a spike of male observations but no similar spike for female fish of a similar size within that year (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details).  The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery were variable by year with fairly large confidence intervals (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). 

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year an sex (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). The mean length obseved across years with data lower in the early 2000s (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). Throughout the mid-2000s the mean length shifts to a larger size (around 40 cm) with a decreased variation in the observed lengths (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The mean length was highly variable in 2015 and 2016 due to low sample sizes (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}) 

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in [Appendix A](#append_a). Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}.  The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet length data generally well.  The commercial fleet shows a wider range of size selected at lower frequencies compared to the recreational fleet which has an aggregated peak around 45 cm approximately. The model overestimated the selectivity for female fish at the largest size relative to observed data from the commercial fleet. The model underestimates the proportion of male fish selected at their peak for both the commercial and recreational fleets.

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output from the base model slowly declines until around the year 2000 and then increases due to several above average recruitments that occurred in the mid- to late-1990s. The population then increases for a short period and declines to the final year of the model. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`, Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is relatively large ranging between the management threshold of 25 to approximately 80 percent of unfished. 

The slight dome shape in the final selectivity for the recreational fleet results in a small fraction of large fish that unavailable in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:unavail-bio}). The fraction of large fish unavailable is relatively small portion of the overall biomass and in theory would be available for selection from the commercial fishery.   

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r print(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Strong recruitment events were estimated to have occured in 1994 and 1997 which resulted in a subsequent increase in biomass during the 2000s. While the largest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occured in these two specific years, the surrounding years also have above average recruitment estimated.  This series of above average recruitment years were likely due to lack of specific information in the length data as to which years had strong recruitment.

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` millions of eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has bounced above and blow the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in recent years (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.
