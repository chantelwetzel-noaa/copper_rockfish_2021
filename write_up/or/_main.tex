This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the Oregon coast using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring of copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population subdivision has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are a relatively long-lived rockfish estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This analysis calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Off the coast of Oregon, copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Landings from the commercial fishery were minimal until the mid-1960s. Following the development of the nearshore commercial fishery in the late 1990s, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) implemented a state-permitted limited access fishery that regulated fleet size, period landing limits and established harvest guidelines {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Rodomsky, Calavan, and Lomeli 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish is one of 11 species in the Other Nearshore Rockfish category managed under a single state harvest guideline. Within this management category, China, quillback and copper rockfish are the three primary species landed. Currently, this commercial fishery is centered on the southern Oregon coast. copper rockfish is primarily landed live as a part of this fishery, but some landings are made to the fresh market. The average sized copper rockfish landed in the commercial fishery, live or dead, was 17 inches (43 cm) and around 4 lbs. with a minimum size limit of 12 inches (30.5 cm) since 2000 (Troy Buell, ODFW, personal communication). Copper rockfish are primarily landed on hook and line and bottom longline gears in the commercial fishery. The recreational fishery off the coast of Oregon developed during the 1970s, with the first recorded landings of copper rockfish in 1979. Recreational removals have increased across time (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

This analysis assesses the stock off the Oregon coast as a separate stock from other populations off the West Coast based on the fairly sedentary nature of copper rockfish, which likely limits flow of fish between California and Washington. The substrate of the northern Oregon and southern Washington coast is primarily sandy bottom and combined with the Columbia River plume between Oregon and Washington, these factors create a natural separation between the Oregon and Washington populations. Additionally, the exploitation history and magnitude of removals off the Oregon coast has been dramatically lower than removals off the California coast.

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes, split at 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. Each complex, comprised of nearshore rockfish species, is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catch) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex (North or South). Removals for species within the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complexes are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

Table \ref{tab:ofl} shows the Nearshore Rockfish North complex level OFL and ACL, the copper rockfish OFL and ACL contribution amounts, the state-specific allocations (49 percent for Oregon, Groundfish Management Team, personal communication) of the copper rockfish ACL contribution, and the total removals in Oregon.

In Oregon, historical commercial landings from 1892 to 1986 were provided by the ODFW {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Karnowski, Gertseva, and Stephens 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Historical landings were negligible until 1927 after which landings were consistent but minimal (\textless{} 1 mt) until the 1970s, at which point landings increased to a high of 2.2 mt in 1978. Primary gear types during this historical period included longline and troll gears. However, ODFW commercial samplers suggest that these troll landings were primarily landed on hook and line gear, but not separated by gear type on the fish tickets (M. Freeman, ODFW, personal communication).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Landings from 1987 - 1999 were compiled from a combination of PacFIN, the central repository for West Coast commercial landings (extracted on 10/13/2020), and a separate ODFW reconstruction that delineated species-specific landings in the unspecified rockfish categories on PacFIN (e.g., URCK and POP1, ODFW 2017). Copper rockfish landings from this reconstruction were substituted for the URCK and POP1 landings available from PacFIN, and added to PacFIN landings from other categories for a complete time series during this time period. Commercial landings from 2000 - 2020 are available on PacFIN (extracted on 10/13/2020 and 02/18/2021). Copper rockfish is one of several rockfish species targeted by a nearshore, primarily live-fish fixed gear fishery centered on Oregon's southern coast. Copper rockfish is landed primarily with hook and line gear, but a substantial portion is also landed with bottom longline gear as well. On average, 99.1 percent of copper rockfish landings are from these two gear types (2000 - 2020). In the most recent years, longline landings have eclipsed hook and line landings. Landings from all other gear types, including fish pot and trawl, are minimal relative longline gears. Commercial landings for copper rockfish increased from the mid-1960s to 1974 and have since fluctuated between approximately 0.5 and 2.5 mt annually. In 2003, ODFW implemented a state-permitted limited access fishery that regulated fleet size, period landing limits and established harvest guidelines {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Rodomsky, Calavan, and Lomeli 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. From 2003 to 2020, landings have averaged 1.1 mt annually. Commercial removals were aggregated across gear types into a single fleet in the base model. Commercial removals for all years are shown in Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discard totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. Discard mortality prior to the start of WCGOP data in 2002 were calculated by multiplying the annual landings by 4.4 percent, the average coastwide discard rate from WCGOP. The calculated state specific discard amount based on the GEMM was averaged across 2016-2019 to determine the amount of discards to adjust landings in 2020.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial copper rockfish length samples are available from PacFIN from 1999 - 2020 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}, extracted on 2/21/2021). Approximately 50.9 percent of these samples are females (n = 714) and 48.9 percent are males (n = 686). Only four fish were unsexed. The majority (82.8 percent) are from the southern Oregon coast, centered in Port Orford (63.9 percent) and Gold Beach (19.0 percent), where the majority of permit holders for the commercial nearshore fishery are based and where most of the landings are made. The majority of length samples are from copper rockfish landed live (67.0 percent).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The length observations from 1999 - 2002 and 2017 were not used in the base model due to large observations of small fish. There was limited information content in the commercial and recreational lengths about recruitment strength, except for evidence of a potentially above average recruitment in the late 1990s. Retaining years of data with small fish observations in a deterministic model led to a leftward shift in commercial selectivity (i.e., selectivity of small fish) that resulted in implausible estimates of stock size (i.e., stock size went to upper bound of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). The remaining years of commercial length data were then input into the model as unsexed observations due to low sex-specific sample sizes by years resulting in jagged composition data when split by sex. The commercial length data by sex for all years are provided in the Appendix, Section \ref{append-com}. The omitted data years (1999-2002 and 2017) were used as a `ghost' fleet, not fit by the model, but implied fits reflected in diagnostic plots shown in Section \ref{append-com}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The lengths observed by the commercial fishery used in the base model ranged between 30 - 54 cm (the maximum length data bin size, Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The mean size observed by the commercial fishery was relatively variable from year to year with the mean length occurring between 41 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) which incorporate the number of trips and fish by year:

\emph{Historic Ocean Boat Landings (1979 - 2000)}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Recently, the ODFW undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001. Reconstructed catch estimates from the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS) improve upon estimates from the federal Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS), which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Van Voorhees et al. 2000)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by ODFW. However, the ORBS sample estimates are known to lack the comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of MRFSS. Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction. In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick et al. 2016, 2018; Haltuch et al. 2018; Cope et al. 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Prior to 2001, ORBS monitored marine species in both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and other miscellaneous fishes, and as individual species, such as lingcod or Pacific halibut. For this comprehensive reconstruction, four species categories were selected to reconstruct, including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish and miscellaneous, which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species. Copper rockfish are a component of the rockfish species category.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage in two separate pathways. First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled winter months in years lacking complete coverage. Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch. Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates. A subset of landings were sampled by ORBS for species compositions within these categories. Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time, species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories, including rockfish, flatfish and miscellaneous fish. Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and determined based on a series of regression tree analyses that detailed the importance of each domain (year, month, port and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Ocean boat estimates from 1979 - 2000 in numbers of fish of copper rockfish from the above described methods were converted to biomass using biological samples from MRFSS (A. Whitman, ODFW, personal communication). MRFSS biological data are available from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - 2000. An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish to obtain an annual landings estimate. Several years missing biological data (1979, 1990 - 1992) were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation. These landings in biomass were provided by ODFW and do not include an estimate of discards. Landings during this time period gradually increase, to a peak of 4.2 mt in 1998, but fluctuate annually.

Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001 - 2020 are available from RecFIN.

Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC. From 2001 - 2020, landings averaged 4.1 mt, ranging from 1.0 to 9.3 mt.

Data sources include MRFSS and the Oregon Shore and Estuary Boat Survey (SEBS). Numbers of fish were provided by MRFSS from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - June 2003, and by SEBS from July 2003 - June 2005. An annual mode-specific average weight was applied to numbers of copper rockfish from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - 2005. Separate average weights were calculated for shore and estuary boat modes, and excluded extreme outliers and imputed values. This reconstruction also applied two scaling factors to remove bias towards freshwater sampling and underestimation of estuary boats, as detailed in Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. To estimate copper rockfish landings from July - December 2005, an expansion was developed using the three year average of the ratio between the first six months of the year and the total annual landings from MRFSS and SEBS landings from 2002 - 2004. Separate expansions were developed for shore mode and estuary boat modes.

The ODFW does not currently sample shore and estuary boat fishing trips, and so a 10 year average landing (1996 - 2005; 1.4 mt per year) was used to estimate shore and estuary boat landings during 2006 - 2020. Shore and estuary boat landings combined gradually increased until peaking in 2003 at 3.3 mt. Shore and estuary boat landings averaged 1.0 mt annually from 1980 - 2003.

Recreational removals were aggregated across modes into a single fleet in the model. The removal assumptions in the base model are shown in Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}. No additional recreational discard mortality was added to historical removals for the recreational fleet because the 15 fish bag limits during this period is thought to not have been restrictive enough to induce appreciable size-based discarding of copper rockfish.

Recreational length samples were obtained from three sources: MRFSS, RecFIN (ORBS) and ODFW special project sampling. From 1980 - 1989 and from 1993 - 2000, the MRFSS program collected samples from both ocean and inland (estuary) areas. ODFW provided MRFSS samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values; however, sample size was limited and therefore, imputed lengths were used. From 1980 - 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by MRFSS, which were converted to fork length. From 1993 - 2000, fork length (mm) was collected. Length samples from 2001 - 2020 from the ORBS sampling program are available on RecFIN. All ORBS samples are by fork length (mm). The vast majority (82 percent) of these samples are from ocean trips. Table \ref{tab:len-samps} details sample sizes by year used in the base model. Retention of copper rockfish was not allowed under recreational state regulations in 2015 or 2016, limiting the number of samples in those years. Length samples in 2020 from the recreational fishery were limited due to COVID-19 sampling changes.

The length observations from 1980 to 1999 were not used in the base model due to low annual sample sizes that led to noisy length compositions by year. These data were used in the model as a `ghost' fleet, not fit by the model, but implied fits reflected in diagnostic plots. The implied fit to these data from the base model are shown in the Appendix, Section \ref{append-rec}. The distribution of the lengths in the recreational data since 2000 generally ranged between 35 - 50 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The mean length by year in the recreational data was generally smaller starting at 2000, slowly increasing until 2005, after which the mean lengths observed by year became relatively stable with tight 95 percent confidence intervals (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}).

The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This approach modifies work done by Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} who estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Hamel (personal communication) re-evaluated the data used by Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} by fitting the one-parameter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hamel 2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), the point estimate and median of the prior for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is:

This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and was supported by the observed ages which had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}). The available fishery-dependent data from Oregon and Washington included limited observations of young fish (less than 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and the size-at-age 0 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(t_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. Ideally, growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observations that did not cover the range of ages.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.4 cm; $k$ = 0.206

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.2 cm; $k$ = 0.231

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.

The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} from the Lea study were quite a bit larger for both sexes than those estimated for this assessment using recent length and age data off the coast of Oregon and Washington. In the Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} young fish were well sampled, however, there were very few observations of fish older than 12 years of age (less than 5 total) which appears to have led to a poorly informed estimate of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

For the sake of parsimony, the length-age samples were pooled across sources to estimate a single length-at-age curve for copper rockfish in California north of Point Conception, Oregon, and Washington.

First, the 2013 assessment document did not report catches on a state and source level (not atypical for grouped state or area assessment). Secondly, some of the recreational indices used in 2013 were calculated based on multi-state data.

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was estimated at 3.65. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic for the commercial fleet with a peak in maximum selectivity for fish at 40.8 cm. The estimate of the peak selectivity was highly sensitive to which years of commercial data were used and whether recruitment deviations were estimated in the model. Early years of the commercial data have large observations of small fish, likely due to a large late-1990s year class, resulting in a wide range of observed lengths across all years for this fleet. If recruitment deviations were estimated the model was able to fit these observations of small fish with large recruitment deviations and estimating selectivity to be highly right-shifted (selectivity peak at 49.7 cm). However, there appeared to be limited information in the length data regarding recruitment, aside from a few select years in the late 1990s. If recruitment was estimated to be deterministic (recruitment deviations equal to 0) the estimated peak selectivity for the commercial fleet was poorly informed. Depending upon the parameter starting value, the model would either estimate a relatively small size for peak selectivity (32 cm to fit the high proportion of small fish observed in select years) or a larger peak (45 cm an upward). To stabilize the estimation of the commercial selectivity years with high observations of small fish and were not considered indicative of the overall selectivity pattern were removed (1999 - 2002, 2017). The estimated peak of selectivity of 40.8 cm was consistent with \emph{a priori} expectations of the general size of copper rockfish observed in the commercial fleet (Troy Buell and Brett Rodomsky, ODFW, personal communication). However, the base model estimate around commercial peak selectivity was uncertain with the 95 percent asymptotic intervals ranging from 37.6 - 44.1 cm. Sensitivities to the shape of the commercial selectivity with recruitment deviations estimated were explored as sensitivities (see Section \ref{sensitivities} for details) with a profile across the peak parameter provided in the Section \ref{like-profiles}.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The selectivity for the recreational fleet was estimated to be dome-shaped at the largest sizes. The peak of the selectivity curve by the recreational fleet was estimated to be 47.5 cm. Sensitivities to the shape of the recreational selectivity were explored (see Section \ref{sensitivities} for details). The limited dome-shape in selectivity could arise due to targeting of other species. Often recreational fishing at deeper depths, where the largest copper rockfish are likely to occur, are targeting of lingcod. Targeting lingcod using larger hooks and/or baiting hooks with herring would likely preclude catching larger copper rockfish.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery are low overall, with a possible pattern of observations exceeding expected values above 40 cm between 2007 - 2014 (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery range between 41 - 45 cm across years and with the model expected mean length flat across years (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals were relatively small (max residual size of 4.79) for the recreational length data but patterns were variable by year and sex (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). There was a solid block of observations exceeded model expectations (solid bubbles) between 20 - 40 cm from 2000 - 2004 which, based on the length-at-age, could indicate one or more above average recruitment events in the 1990s. This pattern of residuals continues in later years where there where the observations were greater than the model expectations for sizes above 40 cm. Throughout the mid-2000s the mean length shifts to a larger size (around 40 cm) with a decreased variation in the observed lengths (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}).

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-fit}. Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet length data generally well. The commercial fleet shows a slightly wider range of sizes compared to the recreational fleet, which has an aggregated peak around 45 cm approximately. Even when combined into unsexed composition data the aggregated commercial length data was noisy with multiple peaks in the data. The model overestimated the selectivity for fish between 35 - 42 cm and underestimated the peak around 47 cm.

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The estimates of spawning output across time are uncertain with the base model estimating a spawning output of 28.51 in 2021 with a 95 percent asymptotic interval ranging from 3.98 - 53.03 millions of eggs. The predicted spawning output from the base model slowly begins declining in the early 1980s when catches from the commercial and recreational fleet began to increase (Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The population then continues to slowly decline, with slight increases in spawning output in 2016 and 2017 due to low removals in 2015 and 2016 (years where retention was prohibited in the recreational fishery). The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (73.6 percent, Figure \ref{fig:depl}).

Estimating recruitment deviations resulted in large changes in estimated stock size and status relative to the base model. The sensitivity that estimated recruitment deviations for all model years estimated a lower initial stock size relative to the base model (14.1 vs 38.8 million eggs) and the estimated stock status (30 percent) was below the management target (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1} and Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}). This sensitivity estimated a multiple large recruitments in the late-1990s with only a few years after 2000 having above average recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:sens-recdev-1}). The two other sensitivities exploring the estimation of recruitment deviations (Rec. Devs. Fix Comm. and Rec. Devs. 1927-2000) each estimated stock scale and statuses that were intermediate to the all recruitment deviations sensitivity (Rec. Devs.) and the base model.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Data weighting with the Francis method or the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) had large impacts on estimated stock size. If the Francis method was used to weight the composition data the estimated log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was significantly higher compared to the base model (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}). In comparison to the McAllister-Ianelli data weighting the Francis method applied a higher weight to the commercial lengths and a lower weight to recreational lengths (Table \ref{tab:dw}). The DM method also applied a higher weight to the commercial lengths and a relatively low weight to the recreational lengths compared to the base model similar to the Francis method. However, the estimates of stock size did not approach the log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) upper bound, although the estimated stock scale and status were higher compared to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}).

Sensitivities that explored estimating select growth parameters had similar estimates of spawning output and fraction unfished to the base model (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-1}) except for the sensitivity that estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for both sexes. The estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for both sexes were lower than the fixed values in the base model, resulting in significantly higher estimated initial spawning output with the stock near unfished (Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-1}).

Inputting the commercial lengths as sex-specific compositions estimated a higher stock scale but overall similar fraction unfished trajectory relative to the base model (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The change in estimated stock size was primarily driven by a leftward shift in the peak selectivity parameter (37.9 cm, Table \ref{tab:sensitivities-2}). The general behavior led to the decision that the base model would use these data as unsexed lengths which appeared to improve the signal from these data regarding selectivity in the model.

In regards to values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately a log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) of 3.65 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The recreational lengths provide the majority of the information regarding {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} where the commercial lengths support higher values. Increasing the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, relative to the value estimated, results in an increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}).

For steepness, values across the profiled range, 0.30 to 1.0, all resulted in negative log-likelihood differences that were not significantly different (less than 1.92 units) with the lowest negative log-likelihood occurring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). Assuming higher or lower steepness values had minimal impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}).

An additional analysis to estimate stock status based on length data alone was conducted within a length only version of Stock Synthesis. Within this approach the removal history is removed but the same life history values, selectivities, and length compositions (both sexed and unsexed) are used. The underlying assumption is that the population has gone through an aggregate constant catch and constant recruitment in order to get an estimate of the current stock status. Length compositions are fit by estimating the parameter log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) (considered a nuisance parameter) which allows for best fits to the length comps and the selectivity by fleet. This analysis was conducted under either the assumption of asymptotic recreational selectivity curve or the dome-shaped selectivity from the base model. Using the recreational lengths, the estimated asymptotic selectivity, and life history from the Oregon base model the implied stock status in 2020 was estimated to be approximately 0.47. In contrast, the estimated stock status in 2020 was 0.57 when the selectivity was assumed to be dome-shaped.

Assuming a stock status lower than the base model and close to the management target of 0.40, SSS resulted in an OFL and ABC values that were significantly lower (base model OFL in 2023 = 17.98 versus 5.07 mt, base model ABC in 2023 = 15.71 versus 3.89 mt).

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). Removing the final 3 - 5 years of data resulted in a decline is spawning output relative to the base model likely due to the limited length samples from the recreational fishery available in 2015 and 2016 when retention was prohibited in the Oregon recreational fishery.

Copper rockfish is assessed as four distinct stocks off the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California; north of Point Conception in California; Oregon; and Washington. The area north of Point Conception off the coast of California was estimated to have the largest unfished spawning output of copper rockfish off the West Coast. The stocks off of the Oregon and Washington coast are smaller in size compared to the California stocks with the stock off the coast of Washington estimated to have the smallest unfished spawning output. Comparison of the estimated spawning output trajectories for the California stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-ca-compare} with Oregon and Washington shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-orwa-compare}. The fraction unfished across all West Coast stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:depl-compare}. The California stocks are estimated to be the most depleted with the stock south of Point Conception estimated below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished and the stock north of Point Conception estimated to be in the precautionary zone (less that the management target of 40 percent but above the management threshold). The stock off the coast of Washington is estimated to be just above the management target and the Oregon stock well above the target.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields were 11.87 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SB}_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 17.29 million eggs.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimate 2021 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the management target of 40 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}).

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for copper rockfish was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{itemize}

    \item Continue collecting length and otolith samples from both the commercial and recreational catches. 

    \item The peak of commercial selectivity was highly uncertain in the base model with the estimated parameter having a large influence on the estimated stock scale and status. Data collections should continue to collect length and age data from this fleet. 

    \item The recreational selectivity form (i.e., asymptotic versus dome-shaped) was a source of uncertainty in the base model. Improved understanding of where recreational fishing is commonly occurring (areas and depths) and the range of sizes available by depth would be beneficial to better understand selectivity form.

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in helping the STAT team to understand the data and as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not copper rockfish along the coast. Melissa Head provided an area specific maturity estimate for copper rockfish and provided insight in the complex biological processes that govern maturity processes.

All of the data-moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, Bill James, and Daniel Platt provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the copper rockfish assessments conducted this year.

The `ghost' fleet data consist of commercial length samples collected 1999-2002 which were not used in the base model due issues estimating selectivity. These years have increased observations of small fish likely due to a strong late 1990s recruitment that caused selectivity to shift leftward, estimating a relatively low peak selectivity when recruitment was assumed to be deterministic. The data from 2017 was also removed due to lower sample sizes and a large proportion of small fish observed in the length composition data.

One source of information that fell outside the bounds of the current PFMC Groundfish Terms of Reference for Data Moderate assessment is the ODFW Marine Reserve Hook and Line Survey. This data source to date has not been used in any West Coast groundfish stock assessments, but will likely be considered in select future full rockfish assessments (e.g., black rockfish). Given that this is an existing data source that may prove useful for future rockfish assessments, we wanted to provide an overall summary of this data source and the available data for copper rockfish.

The Marine Reserve Program in the ODFW has routinely monitored state marine reserves (MR) and associated comparison areas (CA) since 2011. Data from the hook and line survey from 2011 - 2019 are presented in this summary. Surveys in 2011 and 2012 only visited a single site, Redfish Rocks. Surveys from 2013 -- 2019 include reserves and comparison areas from four sites: Redfish Rocks, Cape Falcon, Cape Perpetua and Cascade Head. Each of these four sites has a marine reserve and one to three comparison areas. Comparison areas are specifically selected for each marine reserve to be similar in location, habitat and depth to the reserve but are subject to fishing pressure. Not all sites are sampled in each year, due to both the gradual implementation of the reserve network and the available staff to execute surveys. Sites and areas sampled that are included in this dataset are below.

Areas differ in both geographic location and the level of fishing pressure experienced or allowed. Staff from the Marine Reserves Program suggested that the treatment (reserve vs.~comparison area) may not be a delineating factor for the catch of some species (e.g., cabezon) due to the recent implementation of the reserves. It was suggested that data could be aggregated to the site level, functioning at the level of a reef complex, to examine patterns at different locations along the coast. However, this may not be possible with the sample size available at some sites.

Additional filtering may not be necessary, as the filtering for ``active'' cells has already likely removed any unsuitable sampling units, based on habitat, depth and local knowledge. Based on the annual proportion of positive cell-days and the relative rarity of copper rockfish encounters, there are probably not enough data to move forward with a time series at a coastwide level. However, Redfish Rocks has been sampled in each year from 2011 - 2019, except for 2018. Though sample size is extremely limited, CPUE at this site shows an increasing trend since 2011 for copper rockfish.

While the CPUE was not used in the base model, comparisons between the trend in Figure \ref{fig:fig-5} and the estimated stock trend in base model can be made. Examining all years the trend in the CPUE in Figure \ref{fig:fig-5} is generally increasing, but noisy, across the survey years. In contrast, the total biomass and spawning biomass trajectories from the base model are slowly declining between 2011 - 2020. However, the base model assumed a deterministic population (no recruitment deviations) which could prevent capturing recruitment driven dynamics which could result in an increasing stock trend independent of catches.

After the first two years in the CPUE series, 2013 - 2019, generally flat in trend with high uncertainty intervals. These years still do not match the trend in the base model; however, the CPUE have be capturing localized trends. This may provide a slightly different view of the population compared to the base model that assumed the equal fishing pressure across the assessed area.
