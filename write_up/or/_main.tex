This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the Oregon coast using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial (mainly in the live-fish fishery in recent years) and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring or copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub-division has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterrey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish is a relatively long-lived rockfish and are estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Off the coast of Oregon, copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. The landings from the commercial fishery were minimal until the mid-1960s. Following the development of the nearshore commercial fishery in the late 1990s, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) implemented a state-permitted limited access fishery that regulated fleet size, period landing limits and established harvest guidelines {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Rodomsky, Calavan, and Lomeli 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish is one of 11 species in the Other Nearshore Rockfish category managed under a single state harvest guideline. Within this management category, China, quillback and copper rockfish are the three primary species landed. Currently, this commercial fishery is centered on the southern Oregon coast. copper rockfish is primarily landed live as a part of this fishery and is one of the predominant rockfish species in this fishery, but some landings are made to the fresh market. Copper rockfish is primarily landed on hook and line and bottom longline gears in the commercial fishery. The recreational fishery off the coast of Oregon developed during the 1970s, with the first recorded landings of copper rockfish in 1979. Recreational removals have increased across time (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

This analysis asseses the stock off the Oregon coast as a separate stock from other populations off the West Coast based on the fairly sedentary nature of copper rockfish, which likely limits flow of fish between California and Washington. The substrate of the northern Oregon and southern Washington coast is primarily sandy bottom and combined with the Columbia River plume between Oregon and Washington these factors create a natural separation between the Oregon and Washington populations. Additionally, the exploitation history and magnitude of removals off the Oregon coast has been dramatically lower than removals off the California coast.

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

Copper rockfish was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one south of Point Conception in California and one north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessment estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target of 40 percent of unfished conditions with the southern area being assessed at 75 percent of unfished and the northern population at 48 percent of unfished. The OFLs and the ACLs from each assessed area were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

In Oregon, historical commercial landings from 1892 to 1986 were provided by the ODFW {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Karnowski, Gertseva, and Stephens 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Historical landings were negligable until 1927 after which landings were consistent but minimal (\textless{} 1 mt) until the 1970s, at which point landings increased to a high of 2.2 mt in 1978. Primary gear types during this historical period included longline and troll gears. However, ODFW commercial samplers suggest that these troll landings were primarily landed on hook and line gear, but not separated by gear type on the fish tickets (M. Freeman, ODFW, personal communication).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Landings from 1987 - 1999 were compiled from a combination of PacFIN, the central repository for West Coast commercial landings (extracted on 10/13/2020), and a separate ODFW reconstruction that delineated species-specific landings in the unspecified categories on PacFIN (e.g., URCK and POP1, ODFW 2017). Copper rockfish landings from this reconstruction were substituted for the URCK and POP1 landings available from PacFIN, and added to PacFIN landings from other categories for a complete time series during this time period. Commercial landings from 2000 - 2020 are available on PacFIN (extracted on 10/13/2020 and 02/18/2021). Copper rockfish is one of several rockfish species targeted by a nearshore, primarily live-fish fixed gear fishery centered on Oregon's southern coast. Copper rockfish is landed primarily with hook and line gear, but a substantial portion is also landed with bottom longline gear as well. On average, 99.1 percent of copper rockfish landings are from these two gear types (2000 - 2020). In the most recent years, longline landings have eclipsed hook and line landings. Landings from all other gear types, including fish pot and trawl, are minimal relative to jig and longline gears and sporadic. Commercial landings for copper rockfish increased from the mid-1960s to 1974 and have since fluctuated between approximately 0.5 and 2.5 mt annually. In 2003, ODFW implemented a state-permitted limited access fishery that regulated fleet size, period landing limits and established harvest guidelines {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Rodomsky, Calavan, and Lomeli 2020)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. From 2003 to 2020, landings have averaged 1.1 mt annually. Commercial removals were aggregated across gear types into a single fleet in the base model. Commercial removals for all years are shown in Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

Commercial copper rockfish length samples are available from PacFIN from 1999 - 2020 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}, extracted on 2/21/2021). Approximately 50.9 percent of these samples are females (n = 714) and 48.9 percent are males (n = 686). Only four fish were unsexed. The majority (82.8 percent) are from the southern Oregon coast, centered in Port Orford (63.9 percent) and Gold Beach (19.0 percent), where the majority of permit holders for the commercial nearshore fishery are based and where most of the landings are made. The majority of length samples are from copper rockfish landed live (67.0 percent).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The lengths observed by the commercial fishery range between 30 - 54 cm (the maximum length data bin size, Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The mean size observed by the commercial fishery was relatively variable from year to year with the mean length occurring between 40 - 45 cm across both sexes (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}).

\emph{Historic Ocean Boat Landings (1979 - 2000)}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Recently, the ODFW undertook an effort to comprehensively reconstruct all marine fish recreational ocean boat landings prior to 2001 (A. Whitman, ODFW, personal communication). Reconstructed catch estimates from the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey (ORBS) improve upon estimates from the federal Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistical Survey (MRFSS), which have known biases related to effort estimation and sampling {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Van Voorhees et al. 2000)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} that resulted in catch estimates considered implausible by ODFW. However, the ORBS sample estimates are known to lack the comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of MRFSS. Addressing this coverage issue is a major part of this reconstruction. In general, the base data and methodology for these reconstructed estimates are consistent with recent assessments for other nearshore species {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick et al. 2016, 2018; Haltuch et al. 2018; Cope et al. 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Prior to 2001, ORBS monitored marine species in both multi-species categories, such as rockfish, flatfish, and other miscellaneous fishes, and as individual species, such as lingcod or Pacific halibut. For this comprehensive reconstruction, four species categories were selected to reconstruct, including rockfish, lingcod, flatfish and miscellaneous, which constitute the bulk of the managed marine fish species. Copper rockfish are a component of the rockfish species category.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Category-level estimates were expanded to account for gaps in sampling coverage in two separate pathways. First, estimates from five major ports were expanded to include unsampled winter months in years lacking complete coverage. Expansions were based on available year-round sampling data and excluded years where regulations may have impacted the temporal distribution of catch. Second, all other minor port estimates were expanded to include seasonal estimates in years lacking any sampling based on the amount of minor port catch as compared to all major port estimates. A subset of landings were sampled by ORBS for species compositions within these categories. Once category-level landings were comprehensive in space and time, species compositions were applied for the three multi-species categories, including rockfish, flatfish and miscellaneous fish. Borrowing rules for species compositions were specific to the category and determined based on a series of regression tree analyses that detailed the importance of each domain (year, month, port and fishing mode) to variability in compositions.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Ocean boat estimates from 1979 - 2000 in numbers of fish of copper rockfish from the above described methods were converted to biomass using biological samples from MRFSS (A. Whitman, ODFW, personal communication). MRFSS biological data are available from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - 2000. An annual average weight was applied to the total annual number of fish to obtain an annual landings estimate. Several years missing biological data (1979, 1990 - 1992) were filled in using neighboring years or interpolation. These landings in biomass were provided by ODFW and do not include an estimate of discards. Landings during this time period gradually increase, to a peak of 4.2 mt in 1998, but fluctuate annually.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Recreational landings for ocean boat modes from 2001 - 2018 are available from RecFIN. Both retained and released estimates of mortality are included, though retained mortality contributes the vast majority to total mortality. Release mortality is estimated from angler-reported release rates and the application of discard mortality rates from the PFMC. From 2001 - 2020, landings averaged 4.1 mt, ranging from 1.0 to 9.3 mt.

\emph{Shore and Estuary Landings (1980 - 2020)}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

ODFW provided reconstructed estimates of shore and estuary landings for copper rockfish from 1980 - 2020, using methodology similar to recent assessments {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Berger, Arnold, and Rodomsky 2015; Dick et al. 2016; Cope et al. 2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Data sources include MRFSS and the Oregon Shore and Estuary Boat Survey (SEBS). Numbers of fish were provided by MRFSS from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - June 2003, and by SEBS from July 2003 - June 2005. An annual mode-specific average weight was applied to numbers of copper rockfish from 1980 - 1989 and 1993 - 2005. Separate weights were calculated for shore and estuary boat modes, and excluded extreme outliers and imputed values. This reconstruction also applied two scaling factors to remove bias towards freshwater sampling and underestimation of estuary boats, as detailed in Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2018)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. To estimate copper rockfish landings from July - December 2005, an expansion was developed using the three year average of the ratio between the first six months of the year and the total annual landings from MRFSS and SEBS landings from 2002 - 2004. Separate expansions were developed for shore mode and estuary boat modes.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

The ODFW does not currently sample shore and estuary boat fishing trips, and so a 10 year average landing (1996 - 2005; 1.4 mt per year) was used to estimate shore and estuary boat landings during 2006 - 2020. Shore and estuary boat landings combined gradually increase until peaking in 2003 at 3.3 mt. Shore and estuary boat landings average 1.0 mt annually from 1980 - 2003.

Recreational length samples were obtained from three sources: MRFSS, RecFIN (ORBS) and ODFW special project sampling. From 1980 - 1989 and from 1993 - 2000, the MRFSS program collected samples from both ocean and inland (estuary) areas. ODFW provided MRFSS samples with the addition of a column that flagged length values imputed from weights to allow for selection of directly measured values; however, sample size was limited and therefore, imputed lengths were used. From 1980 - 1989, total lengths (mm) were collected by MRFSS, which were converted to fork length. From 1993 - 2000, fork length (mm) was collected. Length samples from 2001 - 2020 from the ORBS sampling program are available on RecFIN. All ORBS samples are by fork length (mm). The vast majority (82.0 percent) of these samples are from ocean trips. Table \ref{tab:len-samps} details sample sizes by year used in the base model. Retention of copper rockfish was not allowed under recreational state regulations in 2015 or 2016, limiting the number of samples in those years.

The length observations from 1980 to 1999 were not used in the base model due to low annual sample sizes that led to noisy length compositions by year.

Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}). The fishery-dependent had limited observations of young fish (less that 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and the size-at-age 0 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(t_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. Ideally growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observation that did not cover the range of ages. Future research should be conducted to collect a range of lengths by area which would allow for estimates of copper rockfish growth.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.4 cm; $k$ = 0.206

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.2 cm; $k$ = 0.231

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.

The ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters were estimated for the commercial fleet.

Sensitivities to the shape of the recreational selectivity was explored (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{sensitivites}{Sensitivies}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details). After discussions with individual knowledgable about the recreational fishery theorized that the limited dome-shape in selectivity could arise due to targeting of other speices. Often recreational fishing at deeper depths where the largest copper rockfish are likely to occur are targeting of lingcod. Targeting lingcod using larger hooks and/or bait hooks with herring would likely limit the ability of catching larger copper rockfish.

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Strong recruitment events were estimated to have occurred in 1994 and 1997 which resulted in a subsequent increase in biomass during the 2000s. While the largest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in these two specific years, the surrounding years also have above average recruitment estimated. This series of above average recruitment years were likely due to lack of specific information in the length data as to which years had strong recruitment. Bias adjustment was applied to the annual estimates of recruitment deviations (Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}). The information content in the length data was low across the final 20 years of the model.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The Person residuals for the commercial fishery have no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The largest residual was observed in 2017 for male fish where there was a spike of male observations but no similar spike for female fish of a similar size within that year (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details). The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery were variable by year with fairly large confidence intervals (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year an sex (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Throughout the mid-2000s the mean length shifts to a larger size (around 40 cm) with a decreased variation in the observed lengths (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The mean length was highly variable in 2015 and 2016 due to low sample sizes (Table \ref{tab:len-samps})

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet length data generally well. The commercial fleet shows a wider range of size selected at lower frequencies compared to the recreational fleet which has an aggregated peak around 45 cm approximately. The model overestimated the selectivity for female fish at the largest size relative to observed data from the commercial fleet. The model underestimates the proportion of male fish selected at their peak for both the commercial and recreational fleets.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output from the base model slowly declines until around the year 2000 and then increases due to several above average recruitment events that occurred in the mid- to late-1990s. The population then increases for a short period and declines to the final year of the model. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output but above the 25 percent threshold (0.29, Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is relatively large ranging between approximately 15 - 45 percent of unfished.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The slight dome shape in the final selectivity for the recreational fleet results in a small fraction of large fish that unavailable in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:unavail-bio}). The fraction of large fish unavailable is relatively small portion of the overall biomass and in theory would be available for selection from the commercial fishery.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields were 4.49 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 6.26 millions of eggs.

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the target of 40 percent but above the threshold of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-SPR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has bounced above and below the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) from the mid-1990s up until the last four years of the model where the fishing intensity has surpassed the target (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}).

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 10 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The largest change from the base model resulted when recruitment was fixed to be deterministic. The sensitivity estimated a higher stock scale and a less depleted stock relative to the base model. Assuming asymptotic selectivity for the recreational fleet resulted in a reduction in the scale and status of the stock. The sensitivity that used all recreational length data and estimated two time blocks for selectivity estimated similar final stock status and size compared to the base model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Data weighting with the McAllister-Ianelli (MI) resulted in a similar stock trajectory to the base model, however, the Diricthlet-Multinomial (DM) increased the variability in the stock trajectory (slightly higher high and lower low) with a final stock status less depleted than the base model. Estimating single life history parameters, the CV at older ages or female natural mortality, were similar to the base model. In contrast, estimating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for both sexes resulted in a more pessimistic view of the final stock status compared to the base model.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In regards to values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately a log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) of 2.64 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). Both the commercial and recreational data supported lower log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) values. Increasing the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, relative to the value estimated, results in an a sharp increase in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}).

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occurring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). Assuming higher or lower steepness values had minimal impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status was generally within the pre-cautionary zone, between 0.25 and 0.40 of unfished, across steepness values except for the lowest steepness values (0.30 and 0.40) (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortality supported values between 0.105 and 0.125 which included the fixed value of 0.108 (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}).

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis which assumes asymptotic selectivity and deterministic recruitment to produce independent estimates by year of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort based on the observed recreational lengths. This analysis indicated that copper rockfish were 50 percent selected generally between 30 - 40 cm with full selection between 40 - 60 cm (Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). The median estimates of SPR by year had a wide across years between 0.30 - 0.80 (excluding 2016 when retention was prohibited). This type of analysis can provide insight on the fishing effort based on life history and observed length data in the absence of an integrated assessment model. The estimates of SPR by year from the length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis was contradictory to those from the integrated assessment. There are likely multiple reasons why this might be. First, each annual SPR value estimated by the length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis is independent where derived SPR estimats from the base model are based upon the population dynamics and age-structure of the population across time. Secdon, the simplifying assumptions in a length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis is that recruitment is a fixed value which differs from the assumption within the base model where estimated annual recruitment has been below average generally across recent years.

Removing the final 3 - 5 years of data resulted in a decline is spawning output relative to the base model likely due to the limited length samples from the recreational fishery available in 2015 and 2016 when retention was prohibited in the Oregon recreational fishery.

One source of information that fell outside the bounds of the current PFMC Groundfish Terms of Reference for Data Moderate assessment is the ODFW Marine Reserve Hook and Line Survey. This data source to date has not been used in any West Coast groundfish stock assessments, but will likely be considered in select future full rockfish assessments (e.g., black rockfish). Given that this is an existing data source that may prove useful for future rockfish assessments, we wanted to provide an overall summary of this data source and the available data for copper rockfish.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Marine Reserve Program in the ODFW has routinely monitored state marine reserves (MR) and associated comparison areas (CA) since 2011. Data from the hook and line survey from 2011 - 2019 are presented in this summary. Surveys in 2011 and 2012 only visited a single site, Redfish Rocks. Surveys from 2013 -- 2019 include reserves and comparison areas from four sites: Redfish Rocks, Cape Falcon, Cape Perpetua and Cascade Head. Each of these four sites has a marine reserve and one to three comparison areas. Comparison areas are specifically selected for each marine reserve to be similar in location, habitat and depth to the reserve but are subject to fishing pressure. Not all sites are sampled in each year, due to both the gradual implementation of the reserve network and the available staff to execute surveys. Sites and areas sampled that are included in this dataset are below.

Three replicate drifts are executed in each cell. The specific location of the drifts within the cell is selected by the captain. Over time, cells without appropriate habitat for the focus species, mainly groundfish, have been removed from the selection procedures, and those presented in this dataset include only those that are currently ``active''. The number of cells visited in a day can vary slightly and range from three to five. Data are aggregated to the cell-day level.

Areas differ in both geographic location and the level of fishing pressure experienced or allowed. Staff from the Marine Reserves Program suggested that the treatment (reserve vs.~comparison area) may not be a delineating factor for the catch of of some species (e.g., cabezon) due to the recent implementation of the reserves. It was suggested that data could be aggregated to the site level, functioning at the level of a reef complex, to examine patterns at different locations along the coast. However, this may not be possible with the sample size available at some sites.

Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was calculated by the number of fish per angler hour. The number of anglers and hooks are standardized for each survey. Angler hours have been adjusted for non-fishing time (i.e., travel time, etc.).

Additional filtering may not be necessary, as the filtering for ``active'' cells has already likely removed any unsuitable sampling units, based on habitat, depth and local knowledge. Based on the annual proportion of positive cell-days and the relative rarity of copper rockfish encounters, there are probably not enough data to move forward with a timeseries at a coastwide level. However, Redfish Rocks has been sampled in each year from 2011 - 2019, except for 2018. Though sample size is extremely limited, CPUE at this site shows an increasing trend since 2011 for copper rockfish.
