# Assessment Model

## Summary of Previous Assessments 

`r Spp` was last assesseed in 2013 [@cope_data-moderate_2013]. The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with prior on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). `r Spp` was assessed as two separated stocks, the area South of Pt. Conception off the California coast and the area North of Pt. Conception to the Washington Canada border. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock South of Pt. Conception at 75% of unfished spawning output North of Pt. Conception at 48% of unfished spawning output. 

### Bridging Analysis

A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured to include the area from North of Pt. Conception to the Washington/Canadian border.  


## Model Structure and Assumptions

The Oregon `r spp` area assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters.  The model assumed two fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in `r startyr`. Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within SS for the commercial fleet where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated.  The recreational fleet also used a double normal parameterization with two selectivity shapes estimated for the period of `r startyr` to 1999 and 2000 to `r endyr`. The selectivity in the early period was fixed asymptotic and the selectivity in the final period was allowed estimate reduced selectivity for the largest fish (dome-shaped).  Annual recruitment deviations were allowed to vary by year. 

### Modeling Platform and Structure

Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 was used to estimate the parameters in the model. The R package r4ss, version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

### Priors

## Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the Washington coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.
