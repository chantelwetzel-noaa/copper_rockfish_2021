# Management 

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying and $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and the percent allocation (49 percent) for Oregon state provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT, pers. comm.). 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels to be determined later.
