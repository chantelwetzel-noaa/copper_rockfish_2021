## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 5%. This was repeated 100 times and a better minimum was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian. 


### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Fix natural mortality 10 percent lower at a value of 0.097 per year for both sexes.
  
  \item Fix natural mortality 10 percent higher at a value of 0.119 per year for both sexes.

  \item Fix $L_{\infty}$ 5 percent higher at a value of 52.2 cm for females and 50.5 for males. 
   
  \item Deterministic recruitment from the stock recruitment curve. 

  \item Fix recreational selectivity from 2000 - 2020 to be asymptotic. 

  \item Estimate a single selectivity curve for the recreational fleet that is fixed to be asymptotic.  

  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli method using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet method where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}.

The largest change from the base model resulted in the two sensitivities examining alternative selectivity assumptions for the recreational fleet.  Fixing the final selectivity (years 2000-2010) to be asymptotic in this fleet resulted in a more pessimistic estimate in the final years stock size and relative status. In comparison to the base model, the estimates from this sensitivity were generally more extreme; lower log($R_0$), more extreme positive recruitment deviations, and a more variable time series (higher highs and lower lows). Fixing selectivity to by asymptotic and estimating a single selectivity pattern across all years for the recreational fleet also estimated a lower stock size with the stock being more depleted in the final model year. 

A sensitivity of assuming a lower $L_{\infty}$ was also conducted but not presented here. Assuming the $L_{\infty}$ to be lower than the input value resulted in a dramatic and unrealistic shift in stock scale upwards resulting in an unfished population status. 

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}).  Removing 3 and 4 years of data resulted in a decline is spawning output relative to the base model likely due to the limited length samples from the recreational fishery available in 2015 and 2016 when retention was prohibited in the Oregon recreational fishery. 

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, female maximum length, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). Both the commercial and recreational data supported lower log($R_0$) value. Increasing the $R_0$, relative to the value estimated, results in an a sharp increase in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.30 to 1.0 were supported with the lowest negative log-likelihood occuring at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  Assuming higher or lower steepness values had minimal impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status ranged between around the minumum threshold (0.25) to above the management target depending upon assuming a lower or higher steepness value (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortatliy supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The estimate stock trajectories assuming lower or higher natural mortality values impacted the estimated unfished spawning output and resulted in stock statuses within the management precautionary zone (between 0.25 - 0.40) and above (Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}). 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}).  The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between 48 and 50 cm. The $L_{\infty}$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` based on length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status is quite variable across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}).
