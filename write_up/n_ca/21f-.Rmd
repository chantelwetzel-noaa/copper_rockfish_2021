## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

Figure \ref{fig:catch}

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards.  Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication, IPHC):

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

The input sample sizes were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year.
