## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

State description of recreational removal data --- To be provided by Budrick.



The commercial removals for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (Table {tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). For commercial landings prior to 1969, we queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports North of Point Conception. To allocate catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception, we followed an approach used by Dick et al. (2007) for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the CDFW Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table XXX). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, we see this as the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010], and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-77 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969-1977 for all port complexes.  See Appendix A of Dick et al. (2007) for further details.
 
Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN database, extracted XX, 2021. Landings were separated for the area North of Pt. Conception based on port of landings. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards.  Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002-2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent. 

The quantity of length samples from the commercial fishery were low until 1991 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}).  Length samples were the greatest during the 1990s and since 2002 the number of lengths samples by year have been relatively low. The sizes observed from 1978 - 2007 was relatively broad ranging from approximately 25 - 54 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Since approximately 2008 the frequency of sizes observed shifted to smaller lengths around 30 cm while still observing larger individuals. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}) which could be do to shifts in fishey behavior and or changes in the population demographics (e.g., incoming strong recruitments). 

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication, IPHC) based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Recreational Fishery

State description of recreational removal data --- To be provided by John B. 

The recreational removals prior to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 [@ralston_documentation_2010] which were available split north and south of Pt. Conception. Recreational removals from 1980 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS and 1993-2020 were obtained from RecFIN. Both data sources provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus discarded fish.  The missing years between the MRFSS and RecFIN data years, 1990-1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals based on 1989 and 1992 values. 

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of `r spp`. The recreational catches of `r spp` North of Pt. Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined sharply in the 1990s and early 2000s.  The removals remained relatively low until 2015 and after.  The increase in removals in 2015 is likely due to new Annual Catch Limits being updated based on the 2013 assessment [@cope_data-moderate_2013].  

The number of length observation by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}. The highest samples by year occured within the last 15 years of the modeled period. A broad range of sizes, between 20 - 50 cm, have been observed from the recreational fishery across available data years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The mean size observed ranged between 30 to approximately 38 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}).



The input sample sizes were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year.
