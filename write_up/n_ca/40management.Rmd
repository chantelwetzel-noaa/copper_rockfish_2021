## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying with $P^*$ = 0.45 combined with the 40-10 harvest control rule (e.g., adjusts the ABC values when a stock in below 40 perfect of unfished) for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The area assumed in this assessment does not align with the PMFC management regions that define `r spp` ACL allocation, north and south of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. To determine the amount of the ACL for the California portion of the stock north of Point Conception assessment the total ACL that would be allocated to the state of California was determined by summing the S. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. ACL and the percent of the N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. allocated to California (25 percent, PFMC Groundfish Management team personal communication). This state specific ACL was then split for north and south of Point Conception based on the observed proportion of the catches occurring by area for the most recent 5-year period. The proportion of combined commercial and recreational removals occurring in the region north of Point Conception was 51.6 percent. The proportion to the adopted California `r spp` total ACL for 2021 and 2022 applied to the area north of Point Conception was 106 and 105 mt.

## Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Both the recreational and commercial length data indicated that selection of `r spp` occurs at sizes that were below the length at 50 percent maturity assumed in the base model. Developing area specific estimates of the length- or age-at-maturity of `r spp` in California waters north of Point Conception would provide additional understanding of the potential impact of size selectivity by each fleet.

	\item At the time of the assessment due to issues in California data in PacFIN (i.e., condition code) length samples landed live vs. dead from the commercial were unable to be identified. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landings would allow for future assessments to account for the range of commercial fishing behavior.
