# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` million eggs. 

The `r endyr + 1` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent but greater that the management limit of 25 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-\text{SPR}$, was above the harvest rate limit ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) between the early 1970s and 2009, below the target between 2010 - 2016, and above the target in the final years of the model  (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). In recent years the stock status has been below the management target with the fishing intensity above and below the target in different years (Figure \ref{fig:phase}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"], 2)`.



## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying with $P^*$ = 0.45 combined with the 40-10 harvest control rule (e.g., adjusts the ABC values when a stock in below 40 perfect of unfished) for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). Since the stock is estimated to be below the management target the buffer value in Table \ref{tab:project} reflect both the 40-10 harvest control rule adjustment and the default time-varying scientific uncertainty buffer.

The area assumed in this assessment does not align with the PMFC management regions that define `r spp` ACL allocation, north and south of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. To determine the amount of the 2021 and 2021 ACL for the California portion of the stock north of Point Conception the total ACL that would be allocated to the state of California was determined by summing the S. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. ACL and the percent of the N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. allocated to California (25 percent, PFMC Groundfish Management team personal communication). This state specific ACL was then split for north and south of Point Conception based on the observed proportion of the catches occurring by area for the most recent 3-year period. The proportion of combined commercial and recreational removals occurring in the region north of Point Conception was 56 percent based on input from the Groundfish Management Team.    

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels to be determined later.

## Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Both the recreational and commercial length data indicated that selection of `r spp` occurs at sizes that were below the length at 50 percent maturity assumed in the base model. Developing area specific estimates of the length- or age-at-maturity of `r spp` in California waters north of Point Conception would provide additional understanding of the potential impact of size selectivity by each fleet.

	\item Length samples could not be divided between live verus dead `r spp` within the commercial fishery. This was due to issues with the California data in PacFIN. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landing would allow for future assessments to better account for the range of commercial fishing behavior.
