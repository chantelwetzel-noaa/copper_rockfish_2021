## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The $R_0$ was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The commercial selectivity was estimated in two blocks 1916 - 2008 and 2009 - 2020. The block in selectivity was aimed to capture the shift in observations of smaller fish in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The early block estimated a gradual slope in selectivity across lengths with selectivity reaching 1.0 at the largest sizes with the parameter hitting the upper bound of 55 cm.  To reduce problems in convergence the final model fixed this parameter at just below the upper bound at 54.99 cm. The more recent commercial selectivity shifted leftward resulting in increased selectivity of smaller fish.  This shift in selectivity may be driven by market changes in the live fish fishery which favors plate sized fish. Selectivity in the recreational fishery was assumed constant across the modeled period with maximum selectivity occuring for fish of 31.5 cm and greater. 

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. A peak in recruitment occured in 2008 with 2009 and 2010 alse being estimated to be well above average. While there could have been three above average recruitments occuring in subsequent years, alternatively there may have been a single year with high recruitment which the data is unable to assign to a single year due to the variability in length data.  The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r print(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson})

see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details)  

Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}

The Pearson residuals for the recreation length data are variable by year an sex (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}).

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in [Appendix A](#append_a). Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}.  The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet length data generally well. 

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. 

Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`, Figure \ref{fig:depl}).   

 

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` millions of eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has bounced above and blow the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in recent years (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.
