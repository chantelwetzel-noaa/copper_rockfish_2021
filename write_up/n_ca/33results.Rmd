## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The log($R_0$) was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The commercial selectivity was estimated in two blocks of time; `r startyr` - 2008 and 2009 - `r endyr`. The block in selectivity was aimed to capture the shift in observations of smaller fish in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The early block estimated a gradual slope of increasing selectivity across lengths with selectivity reaching 1.0 at the largest sizes, with the parameter hitting the upper bound of 55 cm.  To reduce problems in convergence the final model fixed this parameter at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_CA_N_Commercial(1)_BLK1repl_1916', 'Value'], 1)` cm, just below the upper bound. In recent years, commercial selectivity shifted left-ward, resulting in increased selectivity of smaller fish with peak selectivity occurring at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_CA_N_Commercial(1)', 'Value'], 1)` cm. The cause of this shift in selectivity is not entirely clear but may be related to management changes shifting effort into shallower depths, the live fish fishery which favors age 3 fish (Dan Platt, personal communication), and or combined with a strong recruitment event entering the fishery that could have resulted in a shift in size targeted by the fishery. 

Selectivity in the recreational fishery was assumed constant across the modeled period with maximum selectivity occurring for fish of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_CA_N_Recreational(2)', 'Value'], 1)` cm and greater. The peak selectivity for both fleets, commercial and recreational fishery, is less than the length-at-50 percent maturity (`r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Mat50%_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 2)` cm). 

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. The bias adjustment applied to the annual recruimtent deviations across time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}. Strong recruitments are estimated to have occurred in 2008, 2009, and 2010. While there could have been three above average recruitments occurring in subsequent years, alternatively there may have been a single year with high recruitment that the model is unable to accurately assign to a single year due to the variability in length data. Above average recruitment in 2008 has been estimated in other rockfish assessments off the West Coast [@gertseva_status_2015;@hicks_status_2015;@wetzel_status_2017]. The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Annual length composition fits are shown in the Appendix, Section \ref{append-fit}.  

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery length data area shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}. The observations of larger fish, greater than 45 cm, are minimally greater than the model expectations prior to 2009. Starting in 2009, the commercial length data shifts to smaller fish with observations greater than model expectations for fish between 25 - 30 cm. The mean length observed in the commercial lengths were generally stable between 1990 - 2003, slightly increasing between 2004 - 2007, and then decreasing to smaller sizes to a low in mean lengths occurring in 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). The observed decline in mean lengths was not fit well by the model using only recruitment deviations, leading to the decision to also allow for a shift in commercial selectivity.  

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, observations greater than expected, for small fish prior to 1997 and are generally variable showing no clear misfit in the model in recent years. In model development, an additional selectivity block for years prior to 1997 were explored to address the pattern in the Pearson residual. These model explorations did estimate a left-ward shift in selectivity for the recreational fleet by approximately 2-3 cm, but had little impact on the overall model results. In the aims of parsimony and simplicity a single selectivity pattern was assumed in the base model. The mean length by year for the recreational fleet was highly variable across years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The recreational lengths show a decrease in the mean length observed around 2011, similar to the commercial data.

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}.  The model fits the aggregated lengths for the recreational fleet length data generally well. The aggregated lengths for the commercial fleet reflected a wide selection across sizes, with the model under-predicting the selection for both small and large fish. Multiple sensitivities were conducted to explore alternative parameterization of commercial selectivity. 

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The estimated spawning output decreases sharply in the late-1970s and continues to decline until reaching low levels in the late-1990s. The spawning output slowly increases between 2000 - 2010 with the rate of population growth increasing after 2011 as fish from recent strong year-classes begin to mature. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The model estimates that the spawning output relative the unfished equilibrium spawning output declined below the management limit of 25 percent around 1984 and remained below the limit until 2015 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The estimated relative stock status of `r round(100*model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 1)` percent at the start of `r endyr + 1` is just below the rockfish relative biomass management target of 40 percent.
