## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The model estimated 113 total parameters: $R_0$, 6 selectivity parameters, and 106 parameters for annual recruitment deviations.  The $R_0$ was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet is shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson})

see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details)  

Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}

The Pearson residuals for the recreation length data are variable by year an sex (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}).

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in [Appendix A](#append_a). Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}.  The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet length data generally well. 

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. 

Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`, Figure \ref{fig:depl}).   

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r print(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. 

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40% of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` millions of eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40% of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has bounced above and blow the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in recent years (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.
