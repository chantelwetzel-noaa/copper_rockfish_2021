This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the California coast, north of Point Conception, using data through 2020.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial (mainly in the live-fish fishery in recent years) and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring or copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub-division has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterrey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish is a relatively long-lived rockfish and are estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Off the coast of California, north of Point Conception, copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality, comprising nearly 85 percent of total removals of copper rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The landings from the commercial fishery have been minimal by year, expect for a brief period between the mid-1980s and early-2000s.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willingness to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs. or 0.5 - 1.4 kgs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs. or 1.4 - 2.7 kgs.), with small fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between \$5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). The proportion of copper rockfish being landed live vs.~dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The population of copper rockfish north of Point Conception to the California/Oregon border is assessed here as a separate stock. This decision was made based on oceanographic, geographic, and fishery conditions. The copper rockfish stock in California waters was split at Point Conception due to water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish population north and south of the area. The northern border for this assessment was defined as the California/Oregon border due to substantial differences in historical and current exploitation levels.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South areas are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complex are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within the complex. Removals for species within the Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one south of Point Conception in California and one north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessment estimated the substocks in each area to be above the management target of 40 percent of unfished conditions with the southern area being assessed at 75 percent of unfished and the northern population at 48 percent of unfished. The OFLs and the ACLs from each assessed area were modified to match the management boundary of North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

Although, management defines OFLs and ACLs North and South of 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

The commercial removals for copper rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live vs.~dead (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The grouping of all commercial landings into a single fleet was driven by the limited length composition data available per gear type. Additionally, commercial length data available in Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for California did not have the needed information to identify samples from live or dead fish (e.g., condition code) preventing the ability to evaluate the data based on live vs.~dead landing.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial landings prior to 1969 were queried the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl', and `unknown' gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports North of Point Conception. Catches from Region 6 to the areas north and south of Point Conception were allocated followed an approach used by Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Ralston, and Pearson 2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, this was the best available option in the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations (Region 0) and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969 - 1979 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969 - 1979 for all port complexes. See Appendix A of Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for further details.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN (extracted 2/22/2021). Landings were separated for the area north of Point Conception based on port of landings. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002 - 2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. The historical commercial discard mortality used to adjust the landings data to account for total removals was calculated based on the average coastwide discard rates from WCGOP of 4.4 percent.

The quantity of length samples from the commercial fishery were low until 1991 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). Due to low annual sample sizes, years prior to 1991 were not used in model fitting (entered as a `ghost fleet' observations to see the implied fit). Length samples were the greatest during the 1990s and since 2002 the number of lengths samples by year have been relatively low. The sizes observed from 1991 - 2007 was relatively broad, ranging from approximately 25 - 54 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Since approximately 2008 the frequency of sizes observed shifted to smaller lengths around 30 cm with larger fish still being observed in the data. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}) which could be do to shifts in fishery behavior, changes in the population demographics (e.g., incoming strong recruitments), or a combination of multiple factors.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

The recreational removals prior to 1981 were obtained from the historical reconstruction starting in 1928 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which were available split north and south of Point Conception. Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 were obtained from Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). MRFSS definition of ``Southern California'' included San Luis Obispo County from 1981 - 1989 requiring the catches from this county to be split out recreational removals for the north of Point Conception. Albin et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1993)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} used MRFSS data to estimate catch at a finer spatial scale from the California/Oregon border to the southern edge of San Luis Obispo County. The ratio of catches (0.316) in San Luis Obispo to the total removals was estimated and used to adjust the MRFSS catches to account for all removals north of Point Conception. Recreational landings from 1993 - 2020 were obtained from California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS available on the Recreational Fisheries Information Network, RecFIN). Both data sources, MRFSS and CRFS, provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish. The missing years between the MRFSS and CRFS data years, 1990 - 1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals between the 1989 and 1993 values.

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish. The recreational catches of copper rockfish north of Point Conception in California waters peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined sharply in the 1990s and early 2000s. The removals remained relatively low until 2015.

The number of length observation by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}. The highest samples by year occurred within the last 15 years of the modeled period. A broad range of sizes, between 20 - 50 cm, have been observed from the recreational fishery across available data years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The recreational lengths reflect an increased observation of smaller fish starting around 2010 which appears to move across lengths in subsequent years which may be indication of an strong recruitment event. The mean size observed ranged between 30 to approximately 38 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}).

This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.

The observations of copper rockfish by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} are limited. The number of tows where copper rockfish were observed in California waters north of Point Conception are shown in Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}. The limited number of tows by year within this area prevented the calculation of an index of abundance for copper rockfish. Additionally, observations using trawl gear may not be informative on population trends for rocky-habitat associated species such as copper rockfish. With limited observations and in the absence of an index of abundance to link these data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}). The fishery-dependent had limited observations of young fish (less that 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and the size-at-age 0 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(t_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. Ideally growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observation that did not cover the range of ages. Future research should be conducted to collect a range of lengths by area which would allow for estimates of copper rockfish growth.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes.

Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for the commercial fleet where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters being estimated. The commercial fishery estimated two selectivity blocks: one from 1916- 2008 and the second from 2009 - 2020.

The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The commercial selectivity was estimated in two blocks 1916 - 2008 and 2009 - 2020. The block in selectivity was aimed to capture the shift in observations of smaller fish in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The early block estimated a gradual slope of increasing selectivity across lengths with selectivity reaching 1.0 at the largest sizes with the parameter hitting the upper bound of 55 cm. To reduce problems in convergence the final model fixed this parameter at 54.999 cm, just below the upper bound. In recent years, commercial selectivity shifted left-ward resulting in increased selectivity of smaller fish with peak selectivity occurring at 26.34 cm. The cause of this shift in selectivity is not entirely clear but may be related to the live-fish fishery which favors age 3 fish (Dan Platt, personal communication) combined with a strong recruitment event entering the fishery. Selectivity in the recreational fishery was assumed constant across the modeled period with maximum selectivity occurring for fish of 31.7 cm and greater. The peak selectivity for both fleets, commercial and recreational fishery, is less than the length-at-50 percent maturity (34.83 cm).

The mean length observed in the commercial lengths were generally stable between 1990 - 2003, slightly increasing between 2004 - 2007, and then decreasing to smaller sizes to a low in mean lengths occurring in 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}).

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}).

In model development, an additional selectivity block for years prior to 1997 were explored to address the pattern in the pearson residual. These model explorations did estimate a left-ward shift in selectivity for the recreational fleet by approximately 2-3 cm, but had little impact on the overall model results. In the aims of parsimony and simplicity a single selectivity pattern was assumed in the base model. The mean length by year for the recreational fleet was highly variable across years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}).

The spawning output slowly increases between 2000 - 2010 with the rate of population growth increasing after 2011 as fish from recent strong classes begin to mature. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The model estimates that the spawning output relative the unfished equilibrium spawning output declined below the management limit of 25 percent around 1983 and remained below the limit until 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of 2021 is estimated to be below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent (0.3) but above the management threshold of 25 percent.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields were 113.45 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 195.56 millions of eggs.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The 2021 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent but greater that the management limit of 25 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-SPR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, was above the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) between the early 1970s and 2009, below the target between 2010 - 2016, and above the target in the final years of the model (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 78 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Deterministic recruitment with annual recruitment based on the stock recruitment curve. 

  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli method (MI DW) using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet Multinomial method (DM DW) where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 

  \item Estimate $L_{\infty}$ for both sexes.

  \item Estimate the coefficient of variation for older fish for both sexes.

  \item Estimate natural mortality for females only.

  \item Fix the commercial fleet selectivity to be asymptotic in the late block.

  \item Parameterize commercial selectivity using a cubic spline to fit the commercial composition data. 

  \item Remove the block in commercial selectivity and estimate a single asymptotic selectivity curve. 

  \item Add selectivity block for the recreational fleet for 1916 - 1997.

  \item Add the onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) index of abundance from northern California used in the 2013 assessment. Sensitivity was allowed to estimated added variance to the index of abundance.

  \item  Add the recreational dockside index of abundance from northern California used in the 2013 assessment. Sensitivity was allowed to estimated added variance to the index of abundance.
  
\end{enumerate}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}. Plots of the estimated time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} - \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}. The majority of sensitivities estimated the final stock status within the precautionary zone, between 25 and 40 percent of unfished spawning output. Assuming deterministic recruitment, annual recruitment from the stock recruitment curve, estimated a more pessimistic final stock status with the final stock status below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished. The sensitivity that estimated female natural mortality estimated a higher unfished spawning output but a similar final stock size, relative to the base model resulting in a final stock status below the management threshold.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The two of the three sensitivities that examined alternative parameterization of the commercial selectivity estimated similar stock size and status to the base model. Fixing the commercial selectivity to be asymptotic in the late block resulted in slightly more depleted stock relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The sensitivity that estimated a single selectivity curve across time estimated a final stock status greater than the base model which was primarily driven by the model estimating a selectivity curve that was between the selectivities by time block within the base model. Given the magnitude of difference in final estimates relative to the base model, additional explorations were conducted. Typically, sensitivity runs assume the same data weighting applied in the base model which allows for direct comparison on the negative log-likelihood across models. Updating the data weighting to this sensitivity resulted in a model that was similar to the base model (31 percent depletion in 2021, Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Each sensitivity which used either the onboard CPFV or dockside recreational index of abundance resulted in similar spawning output and relative biomass to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). Both sensitivities were allowed to estimate additional added variance for the input standard deviation for the index timeseries which is typical practice in West Coast groundfish stock assessments. The estimated added variance for each sensitivity was relatively high: 0.17 added to the CPFV index and 0.27 added to the dockside recreational index.

These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) of 6.08 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The likelihood component driving the estimate of the log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was attributed to the recruitment deviations in the base model with the length data having little to no influence on the estimate. However, length data are the only data in the base model and those data are driving the estimate of annual recruitment deviations. Conducting a profile across {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} with recruitment deviations not estimated in the base model results in a profile where all influence on the estimated parameter is attributed to the length data supporting a similar parameter estimate for log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). This confirms that length data are the key source of information for the estimate of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} in the base model. Assuming higher of lower values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} result in large fluctuations in the scale of the stock and final stock status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

For steepness, values from approximately 0.60 to 0.80 were supported by the negative log-likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). The main source of informing the likelihood across parameter values were the recreational length data. Assuming higher or lower steepness values had a large impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status ranged between 0 - 1.0+ with values of 0.60 and 0.80, values with similar support by the data, resulted in a relative stock status that well below the minimum threshold and target stock status (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortality supported a wide range of values compared to the fixed value in the base model 0.108 (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The range of value explored in the profile resulted in large changed in the unfished stock size and a range of final stock status between 5 - 75 percent of unfished (Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb} and \ref{fig:m-depl}).

A profile across a range of female {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}). The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between approximately 46 - 49 cm. The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value for female fish in the model was fixed at 48.43 based on external model estimates using length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status was quite variable across alternative {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

The {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value for female fish in the model was fixed at 0.206. The stock scale and status increased under lower {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values and assuming higher values resulted in a decrease in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}).

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis which assumes asymptotic selectivity and deterministic recruitment to produce independent estimates by year of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort based on the observed recreational lengths. This analysis indicated the copper rockfish were 50 percent selected size around 25 - 30 cm with full selection typically between 35 - 40 cm (excluding 2017, Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). The median estimates of SPR by year ranged between 0.10 - 0.30 between 2012 - 2019 (lower values of SPR indicate higher exploitation levels). This type of analysis can provide insight on the fishing effort based on life history and observed length data in the absence of an integrated assessment model. Examining the length data by year in isolation, assuming deterministic recruitment indicates that SPR by year has been higher than the proxy rockfish SPR target (0.50) with 50 percent selectivity occurring before the length of 50 percent maturity.

The proportion of combined commercial and recreational removals occurring in the region north of Point Conception was 51.6 percent.

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for copper rockfish was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{itemize}

    \item Both the recreational and commercial length data indicated that selection of copper rockfish occurs at sizes that were below the length at 50 percent maturity assumed in the base model. Developing area specific estimates of the length- or age-at-maturity of copper rockfish in California waters north of Point Conception would provide additional understanding of the potential impact of size selectivity by each fleet.

    \item At the time of the assessment due to issues in California data in PacFIN (i.e., condition code) length samples landed live vs. dead from the commercial were unable to be identified. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landings would allow for future assessments to account for the range of commercial fishing behavior.
