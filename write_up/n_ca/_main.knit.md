# Introduction

## Basic Information

This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (*Sebastes caurinus*) off the California coast, north of Point Conception, using data through 2020.


 
Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska.  The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound.   Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. 

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat [@love_milton_probably_1996]. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish [@lea_biological_1999; @bizzarro_diet_2017-1]. The body coloring of copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive  with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color [@miller_guide_1972] which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (*S. caurinus* and *S. vexillaris*). 

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks [@dick_replicate_2014]. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub division has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations [@buonaccorsi_population_2002; @johansson_influence_2008]. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation [@sivasundar_life_2010]. 

Copper rockfish are a relatively long-lived rockfish estimated to live at least 50 years [@love_milton_probably_1996]. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011]. This analysis calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities. 

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

Off the coast of California, north of Point Conception, copper rockfish is caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality, comprising nearly 85 percent of total removals of copper rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}).  The landings from the commercial fishery have been minimal by year, expect for a brief period between the mid-1980s and early-2000s. 


Off the coast of California, north of Point Conception, copper rockfish are caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Recreational removals have been the largest source of fishing mortality, comprising nearly 85 percent of total removals (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The landings from the commercial fishery have been minimal by year, expect for a brief period between the late-1980s and the 1990s.

Recreational fishers in the early part of the 20th century were focused on nearshore waters near ports, with activity expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time [@miller_spatially_2014]. Prior to the groundfish fishery disaster being declared in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions ranging from 20 fm in the Northern Management Area to 60 fm in the Southern Management Area were put in place in various management area delineations along the state. This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including copper rockfish in the remaining open depths, though season lengths were greatly curtailed.  As a result of the shallower depth restrictions north of Point Conception, a portion of the depth distribution, was closed to fishing for most of the last two decades to facilitate the rebuilding of yelloweye rockfish. 

Following  all previously overfished groundfish species, other than yelloweye rockfish, being declared rebuilt by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm and are currently 100 fm as of 2021. The increased access to deeper depths south of Point Conception with the rebuilding of cowcod is expected to reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent.  To the north of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are prevalent, depth constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area.  As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected, which will likely further reduce the effort in nearshore waters where copper rockfish is most prevalent.

Prior to development of the live-fish market in the 1980s, there was very little commercial catch of copper rockfish, with dead copper rockfish fetching a low ex-vessel price per pound. Copper rockfish were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as incidental catch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.  Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and, rarely, trawl gear. Trawling was prohibited within three miles of shore in 1953 and gill netting within three miles of shore was prohibited in 1994, preventing access to a high proportion of the species habitat with these gear types. Copper rockfish were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or and caught as bycatch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for live landed fish arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market lump fish into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs.), with small, plate-sized, fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between $5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication).  The proportion of copper rockfish being landed live vs. dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. Copper rockfish is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery but also are included in the traditional dead fish fishery off the coast of California. 
 
With the development and expansion of the nearshore live-fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain copper rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date.  The result was reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.   
 
 

Copper rockfish residing between Point Conception and the California/Oregon border are assessed here as a single, separate stock.  This designation was made based on oceanographic, geographic, and fishery conditions.  The copper rockfish population in California waters was split at Point Conception due to water circulation patterns that create a natural barrier between nearshore rockfish populations to the north and south. The northern border for this assessment was defined as the California/Oregon border due to substantial differences in historical and current exploitation levels. Additionally, he fairly sedentary nature of adult copper rockfish, likely limits flow of fish between northern California and areas to the north.

## Summary of Management History and Performance


Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes.  The North and South areas are split at 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. The complex is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values (set equal to the species-specific Acceptable Biological Catch) for the complex are determined by summing the species-specific contributions for all stocks managed in the complexes. Removals for species within the Nearshore Rockfish complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

Table \ref{tab:ofl} show the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complex level OFLs and ACLs, the copper rockfish OFL and ACL contributions amounts for both areas, the state-specific allocations of the copper rockfish ACL contribution (the south copper rockfish ACL plus 25 percent allocated to California from the north ACL), and the total removals for California, north of Point Conception.

<!--chapter:end:20data.Rmd-->

## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

#### Landings

The commercial removals for copper rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live or dead (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The grouping of all commercial landings into a single fleet was driven by the limited length composition data available per gear type.  Additionally, commercial length data available in Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for California did not have the needed information to identify samples from live veruse dead fish (i.e., condition code) preventing the ability to evaluate the data based on live vs. dead landing.  

Commercial landings prior to 1969 were queried from the SWFSC catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, non-trawl, and unknown gear categories. Regions 7 and 8 as defined by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] were assigned to Southern California. Region 6 in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] includes Santa Barbara County (mainly south of Point Conception), plus some major ports North of Point Conception. Catches from Region 6 were allocated to the areas nourth and south of Point Conception following an approach developed by Dick et al. [@dick_status_2007] for the assessment of cowcod. Specifically, port-specific landings of total rockfish from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Fish Bulletin series were used to determine the annual fraction of landings in Region 6 that was south of Point Conception (Table \ref{tab:com-ratio}). Rockfish landings at that time were not reported at the species level. Although the use of total rockfish landings to partition catch in Region 6 is not ideal, this was the best available option given the absence of port-specific species composition data. Years with no data were imputed using the average of ratio estimates from adjacent years. Annual catches from unknown locations and unknown gear types were allocated proportional to the catches from known regions and gears. Catches from known regions, but unknown gears, were allocated proportional to catches by known gears within the same region. In this way, total annual removals in California were kept consistent with those reported by Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010], and assigned to the assessment areas north and south of Point Conception.

In September 2005, newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969-1979 were incorporated into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this, as they have in past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969 - 1979 for all port complexes.  See Appendix A of Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for further details.
 
Commercial fishery landings from 1981-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN (extracted 2/22/2021). Landings were separated for the area north of Point Conception based on port of landings. The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards. Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002 - 2019 were determined based on West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide WCGOP discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings by WCGOP. An average commercial discard mortality rate of 4.4 percent, based on the WCGOP data from 2002 - 2019, was applied to adjust historical landings data to account for total removals 

#### Length Compositions 

The quantity of length samples from the commercial fishery were low until 1991 (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). Due to low annual sample sizes, years prior to 1991 were not used in model fitting (entered as a 'ghost fleet' observations to see the implied fit). When used during model development, the noisy distrbution of years with low sample size prior to 1991, impacted the estimation of selectivity, reducing the fits to the later more informed data years. Length samples were highest during the 1990s, while the number of lengths samples by year have been relatively low since 2002. The range of sizes observed from 1991 - 2007 was relatively broad, ecompassing approximately 25 - 54 cm (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}).  Since 2008, the frequency of sizes observed has shifted to smaller lengths, centered around 30 cm, with larger fish still being observed in the data. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}) which could be due to shifts in fishery behavior, changes in the population demographics (e.g., incoming strong recruitments), or a combination of multiple factors. 

The input sample sizes were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Recreational Fishery

#### Landings

The recreational fishery is the main source of exploitation of copper rockfish. Recreational catches of copper rockfish in California waters north of Point Conception peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Removals declined sharply in the 1990s and early 2000s.  The removals remained relatively low until 2015.  

Recreational removal estimates from 1928 to 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010] which were available split north and south of Point Conception. Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 and 1993 - 2003 were obtained from Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS). MRFSS includes estimates of removals for 1980. However, due to inconsistencies in the estimates of this year in MRFSS, likely due to it being the first year of the survey with low sample sizes, the value for recreational removals from Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] was used.  MRFSS definition of "Southern California" included San Luis Obispo County from 1981 - 1989 requiring the catches from this county to be split out and added to recreational removals for north of Point Conception. Albin et al. [-@albin_effort_1993] used MRFSS data to estimate catch at a finer spatial scale from the California/Oregon border to the southern edge of San Luis Obispo County. The ratio of catches (0.316) in San Luis Obispo to the total removals was estimated and used to adjust the MRFSS catches to account for all removals north of Point Conception. There are three years without removals, 1990 - 1992, available in the MRFSS data. Removals for the missing years were filled in by applying a linear ramp in removals between the 1989 and 1993 values. Recreational landings from 2004 - 2020 were obtained from California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS available on the Recreational Fisheries Information Network, RecFIN). Both data sources, MRFSS and CRFS, provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish.  


#### Length Compositions

Length data for retained catch for MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2019) were downloaded from the RecFIN website.  The lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard CPFVs prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2019 were downloaded from the RecFIN website.  The number of length observation by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}. Years with the highest number of samples occurred within the last 15 years of the modeled period. A broad range of sizes, between 20 - 50 cm, have been observed from the recreational fishery across available data years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). The recreational length data show a pulse of smaller fish starting around 2010, which appears at greater lengths in subsequent years, perhaps indicating of a strong recruitment event.  The mean size observed across years ranged from 30 to approximately 38 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}).

The input sample sizes were equal to the number of length samples available by year.

## Fishery-Independent Data

### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

The observations of copper rockfish by the \Gls{s-wcgbt} are limited.  The number of tows where copper rockfish were observed in California waters north of Point Conception are shown in Table \ref{tab:wcgbts-len}.  The limited number of tows by year within this area prevented the calculation of an index of abundance for copper rockfish. Additionally, observations using trawl gear may not be informative of population trends for rocky-habitat associated species such as copper rockfish. With limited observations and in the absence of an index of abundance to link associated length data to, this data set was not used in the base model.

### Remotely Operated Vehicle Observations

Data collected by Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) fall outside the Terms of Reference (TOR) for catch and length based assessments and were not included in this assessment.  However, data collected by ROV were examined in order to gain insight in copper rockfish north of Point Conception which may provide additional understanding of the data from the commercial, recreational, and survey fleets that are being included in this assessment. 

Length frequency distribution for copper rockfish sampled by the ROV in reference locations open to fishing north of Point Conception show the majority of observations occurring between 10 - 30 fathoms with peak observations between 31 - 35 cm (Figure \ref{fig:rov-open}). The observations in closed areas, marine protected areas where retention is prohibited, had higher number of observations of copper rockfish across sizes and depths (Figure \ref{fig:rov-mpa}). A reduced range of sizes, percent of copper rockfish by length bin, were observed across depths in open areas (Figure \ref{fig:rov-percent-open}) versus closed areas (Figure \ref{fig:rov-percent-mpa}).

## Biological Data{#bio-data}

### Natural Mortality


The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015], a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the $M$ rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. This approach modifies work done by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] who estimated $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator $M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}$. Hamel (personal communication) re-evaluated the data used by Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space [@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $A_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 yr^-1^.  The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values.  The oldest aged copper rockfish was 51 years with two observations, one each off of the coast of Washington and Oregon in 2019.  The maximum age in the model was set at 50 years.  This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of  copper rockfish [@love_milton_probably_1996] and was supported by the observed ages which had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.  

### Length-Weight Relationship


The length-weight relationship for copper rockfish was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the NWFSC Hook and Line survey (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-survey}). The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was W = 9.56e-06$L$^3.19^ and males 1.08e-05$L$^3.15^ where $L$ is length in cm and W is weight in kilograms (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight}).

### Growth (Length-at-Age)


Length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}).  The available fishery-dependent data from Oregon and Washington included limited observations of young fish (less than 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ($k$) and the size-at-age 0 ($t_0$) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ($L_{\infty}$). A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea [-@lea_biological_1999] had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment.  Ideally, growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observations that did not cover the range of ages. 

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.4 cm; $k$ = 0.206

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.2 cm; $k$ = 0.231

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.  

In contrast to the current approach, the length-at-age values cited in the 2013 data-moderate assessment [@cope_data-moderate_2013] for copper rockfish (although not directly used by the data-moderate model) were from Lea [-@lea_biological_1999]. The $L_{\infty}$ from the Lea study were quite a bit larger for both sexes than those estimated for this assessment using recent length and age data off the coast of Oregon and Washington. In the Lea [-@lea_biological_1999] young fish were well sampled, however, there were very few observations of fish older than 12 years of age (less than 5 total) which appears to have led to a poorly informed estimate of $L_{\infty}$.   

For the sake of parsimony, the length-age samples were pooled across sources to estimate a single length-at-age curve for copper rockfish in California north of Point Conception, Oregon, and Washington. In the future, if adequate area based length-age samples across a range of fishery-dependent and -independent source are available, copper rockfish growth should be re-evaluated for possible area-specific variation.

### Maturation and Fecundity


Maturity-at-length is based upon the work of Hannah [-@hannah_length_2014] which estimated the 50 percent size-at-maturity of 34.8 cm and slope of -0.6 for copper rockfish off the coast of Oregon with maturity reaching the asymptote of 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}).  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research from Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for copper rockfish was estimated equal to 3.362e-07$L$^3.68^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.

Table \ref{tab:growth-tab} shows the length-at-age, weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, and spawning output (the product of fecundity and maturity) assumed in the base model.

### Sex Ratio


There were limited sex specific observations by length or age across biological data sources. The sex ratio of copper rockfish by length and age across all available data sources off the West Coast are shown in Figures \ref{fig:len-sex-ratio} and \ref{fig:age-sex-ratio}. The sex ratio of young fish was assumed to be 1:1.

# Assessment Model

## Summary of Previous Assessments 


Copper rockfish was last assessed in 2013 [@cope_data-moderate_2013]. The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with priors on select parameters: natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity. Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, the area south of Point Conception off the California coast and the area north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock south of Point Conception at 75 percent of unfished spawning biomass and the stock north of Point Conception at 48 percent of unfished spawning biomass. 

### Bridging Analysis


A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured to include the area from north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The data types used in the 2013 assessment were catches and indices of abundance.  Matching the 2013 data was not straight forward based aside from the challenges already posed from the alternative model platform (XDB-SRA) and area grouping. First, the 2013 assessment document did not report catches on a state and source level (not atypical for grouped state or area assessment). Secondly, some of the  recreational indices used in 2013 were calculated based on multi-state data. All of these items created significant challenges of how to conduct an effective, logical, and informative bridging analysis for the assessment north of Point Conception.  


## Model Structure and Assumptions

Copper rockfish north of Point Conception off the coast of California are assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters.  The model assumed two fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational with removals beginning in 1916. Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for both the commercial and recreational fleets. The commercial selectivity applied two time blocks for selectivity: 1916 - 2008 and 2009 - 2020. The commercial selectivity block from 1916 - 2008  was fixed to be asymptotic, while the selectivity block from  2009 - 2020was allowed to be dome-shaped.   The recreational fleet selectivity was constant across the model years, 1916 - 2020, and fixed to be asymptotic, although dome-shape selectivity was explored during model development. Annual recruitment deviations were estimated for all years. 

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted used Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the NOAA, NWFSC [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections to older model versions. The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version 1.38.0, along with R version 4.0.1 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 


### Priors


Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model.  The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with  an assumed maximum age of 50 years. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.108 and a standard error of 0.438. 

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard error of 0.15. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

### Data Weighting

Length composition data for the commercial fishery started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Sections \ref{commercial-fishery}. The input sample size for the recreational fishery length composition data was set equal to the number of length samples by year.   

The base  model weighted length data for each fleet using the "Francis method" which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and its associated  standard error, and determines if, across years,  the model is able to adequately match the data. If the model predictions do not adequately match the mean lengths given the associated standard errors, then that data source should be down-weighted (equivalently, the standard errors are increased).  This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution). Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in weighting and model results using McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting [@mcallister_bayesian_1997] and the Dirichlet-Multinomial Weighting [@thorson_model-based_2017].

### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 123 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 5 parameters for selectivity and time blocking of the fleets, 105 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr^-1^, the median of the prior, for both sexes .  The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.6. Growth, maturity-at-length, and length-at-weight was fixed as described above in Section \ref{bio-data}. 

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model. Older copper rockfish are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. After explorations, there was little support for dome-shaped selectivity the recreational fleet and the final selectivity form was fixed to be asymptotic. Selectivity for the recreational fleet was estimated using the double normal parameterization where the ascending width and the size at peak selectivity were estimated.

For the commercial fleet in order to fit a shift in observed lengths, two blocks of selectivity were estimated: 1916 - 2008  and 2009 - 2020.  Selectivity in each time block was estimated using the double normal parameterization where selectivity was assumed asymptotic from 1916 - 2008, estimating the ascending width and the size at peak selectivity, with the shape of selectivity estimated to be dome-shaped from 2009 - 2020, estimating also the final selectivity parameter.


## Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for copper rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, with the goal of estimating a spawning output trajectory for the population of copper rockfish off the California coast north of Point Conception. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were developed to achieve the final base model.

<!--chapter:end:30model.Rmd-->

## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The log($R_0$) was estimated at 6.08. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The commercial selectivity was estimated in two blocks of time; 1916 - 2008 and 2009 - 2020. The block in selectivity was aimed to capture the shift in observations of smaller fish in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). The early block estimated a gradual slope of increasing selectivity across lengths with selectivity reaching 1.0 at the largest sizes with the parameter hitting the upper bound of 55 cm.  To reduce problems in convergence the final model fixed this parameter at 54.999 cm, just below the upper bound. In recent years, commercial selectivity shifted left-ward resulting in increased selectivity of smaller fish with peak selectivity occurring at 26.34 cm. The cause of this shift in selectivity is not entirely clear but may be related to management changes shifting effort into shallower depths, the live-fish fishery which favors age 3 fish (Dan Platt, personal communication), and or combined with a strong recruitment event entering the fishery which could have resulted in a shift in size targeted by the fishery. 

Selectivity in the recreational fishery was assumed constant across the modeled period with maximum selectivity occurring for fish of 31.7 cm and greater. The peak selectivity for both fleets, commercial and recreational fishery, is less than the length-at-50 percent maturity (34.83 cm). 

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. A strong recruitment is estimated to have occurred in 2008 with 2009 and 2010 also being estimated to be well above average. While there could have been three above average recruitments occurring in subsequent years, or alternatively there may have been a single year with high recruitment that the model is unable to accurately assign to a single year due to the variability in length data. Above average recruitment in 2008 has been estimated in other rockfish assessments off the West Coast [@gertseva_status_2015;@hicks_status_2015;@wetzel_status_2017]. The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Annual length composition fits are shown in the Appendix, Section \ref{append-fit}.  

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery length data area shown in Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}. The observations of larger fish, greater than 45 cm, are minimally greater than the model expectations prior to 2009. Starting in 2009, the commercial length data shifts to smaller fish with observations greater than model expectations for fish between 25 - 30 cm. The mean length observed in the commercial lengths were generally stable between 1990 - 2003, slightly increasing between 2004 - 2007, and then decreasing to smaller sizes to a low in mean lengths occurring in 2011 (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). The observed decline in mean lengths was not fit well by the model using only recruitment deviations, leading to the decision to also allow for a shift in commercial selectivity.  

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data are variable by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Pearson residuals were positive, observations greater than expected, for small fish prior to 1997 and are generally variable showing no clear misfit in the model in recent years. In model development, an additional selectivity block for years prior to 1997 were explored to address the pattern in the Pearson residual. These model explorations did estimate a left-ward shift in selectivity for the recreational fleet by approximately 2-3 cm, but had little impact on the overall model results. In the aims of parsimony and simplicity a single selectivity pattern was assumed in the base model. The mean length by year for the recreational fleet was highly variable across years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The recreational lengths show a decrease in the mean length observed around 2011, similar to the commercial data.

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}.  The model fits the aggregated lengths for the recreational fleet length data generally well. The aggregated lengths for the commercial fleet reflected a wide selection across sizes with the model under-predicting the selection for both small and large fish. Multiple sensitivities were conducted to explore alternative parameterization of commercial selectivity. 

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The estimated spawning output decreases sharply in the mid-1970s reaching a low around 2000. The spawning output slowly increases between 2000 - 2010 with the rate of population growth increasing after 2011 as fish from recent strong classes begin to mature. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The model estimates that the spawning output relative the unfished equilibrium spawning output declined below the management limit of 25 percent around 1983 and remained below the limit until 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The relative stock status at the start of 2021 is estimated to be below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent (0.3) but above the management threshold of 25 percent.

## Model Diagnostics


### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 78 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was conducted without attempting to estimate a Hessian. 


### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Deterministic recruitment with annual recruitment based on the stock recruitment curve. 

  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli method (MI DW) using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet Multinomial method (DM DW) where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 

  \item Estimate $L_{\infty}$ for both sexes.

  \item Estimate the coefficient of variation for older fish for both sexes.

  \item Estimate natural mortality for females only.

  \item Fix the commercial fleet selectivity to be asymptotic in the late block.

  \item Parameterize commercial selectivity using a cubic spline to fit the commercial composition data. 

  \item Remove the block in commercial selectivity and estimate a single asymptotic selectivity curve. 

  \item Add selectivity block for the recreational fleet for 1916 - 1997.

  \item Add the onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) index of abundance from northern California used in the 2013 assessment. Sensitivity was allowed to estimated added variance to the index of abundance.
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}. Plots of the estimated time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-1} - \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}. The majority of sensitivities estimated the final stock status within the precautionary zone, between 25 and 40 percent of unfished spawning output. Assuming deterministic recruitment, annual recruitment from the stock recruitment curve, estimated a more pessimistic final stock status with the final stock status below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished.  The sensitivity that estimated female natural mortality estimated a higher unfished spawning output but a similar final stock size, relative to the base model resulting in a final stock status below the management threshold. 

The two of the three sensitivities that examined alternative parameterization of the commercial selectivity estimated similar stock size and status to the base model. Fixing the commercial selectivity to be asymptotic in the late block resulted in slightly more depleted stock relative to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The sensitivity that estimated a single selectivity curve across time estimated a final stock status greater than the base model which was primarily driven by the model estimating a selectivity curve that was between the selectivities by time block within the base model. Given the magnitude of difference in final estimates relative to the base model, additional explorations were conducted. Typically, sensitivity runs assume the same data weighting applied in the base model which allows for direct comparison on the negative log-likelihood across models. Updating the data weighting to this sensitivity resulted in a model that was similar to the base model (31 percent depletion in 2021, Figure \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}).  

The sensitivity which used the onboard CPFV index of abundance resulted in similar spawning output and relative biomass to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:sens-ssb-2} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-2}). The sensitivity was allowed to estimate additional added variance for the input standard deviation for the index time series which is typical practice in West Coast groundfish stock assessments. The estimated added variance for this index of abundance was relatively high, with 0.17 added. 


### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness ($h$), female $L_{\infty}$, female natural mortality ($M$) values, female coefficient of variation for older fish ($CV_2$), and female growth coefficient $k$ separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimating the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

The log($R_0$) negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of 6.08 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The likelihood component driving the estimate of the log($R_0$) was attributed to the recruitment deviations in the base model with the length data having little to no influence on the estimate.  However, length data are the only data in the base model and those data are driving the estimate of annual recruitment deviations. Conducting a profile across $R_0$ with recruitment deviations not estimated in the base model results in a profile where all influence on the estimated parameter is attributed to the length data supporting a similar parameter estimate for log($R_0$).  This confirms that length data are the key source of information for the estimate of $R_0$ in the base model. Assuming higher of lower values of $R_0$ result in large fluctuations in the scale of the stock and final stock status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values from approximately 0.60 to 0.80 were supported by the negative log-likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  The main source of informing the likelihood across parameter values were the recreational length data.  Assuming higher or lower steepness values had a large impact on the unfished and spawning output estimated (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status ranged between 0 - 1.0+. Values of steepness of 0.60 and 0.80, with similar support by the data, resulted in relative stock status that was either well below the minimum threshold or a bit above the target stock status (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortality supported a wide range of values compared to the fixed value in the base model 0.108 (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The range of value explored in the profile resulted in a large change in the unfished stock size and a range of final stock status between 5 - 75 percent of unfished (Figure \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}). 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}). The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between approximately 46 - 49 cm. The $L_{\infty}$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at 48.43 based on external model estimates using length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status was quite variable across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

A profile across a range of female $k$ showed support for values from 0.16 - 0.24 (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile}). The $k$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at 0.206. The stock scale and status increased under lower $k$ values decreased in under higher $k$ value (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}).

The profile across a range of coefficient of variation ($CV_2$) for older females supported $CV_2$ values ranging between 0.05 - 0.09 (Figure \ref{fig:cv-profile}). Assuming lower or higher $CV_2$ values had little impact on the unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:cv-ssb}). However, the estimated final spawning and output and fraction unfised was more optomistic if lower $CV_2$ values were assumed (Figure \ref{fig:cv-ssb} and \ref{fig:cv-depl}).

### Length-Based Spawner-per-Recruit Analysis

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis was also conducect which assumes asymptotic selectivity and deterministic recruitment to produce independent yearly estimates  of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort based on the observed recreational lengths. This analysis indicated the copper rockfish were 50 percent selected around 25 - 30 cm  with full selection typically between 35 - 40 cm  (excluding 2017, Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). The median estimates of SPR by year ranged between 0.10 - 0.30 from 2012 - 2019 (lower values of SPR indicate higher exploitation levels). This type of analysis can provide insight on the fishing effort based on life history and observed length data in the absence of an integrated assessment model. Examining the length data by year in isolation, assuming deterministic recruitment, indicates that SPR by year has been lower (and thus the fishing impact has been higher) than the proxy rockfish SPR target (0.50) with 50 percent selectivity occurring before the length of 50 percent maturity.

### Retrospective Analysis

A ten-year retrospective analysis was conducted by peeling back a year of data from the model from 2020 (e.g., Data -1 Years) to 2010 (e.g. Data -10 Years). The estimated spawning output was generally consistent with the base model when recent years of data were removed with the largest departure from the base model when the largest number of data years were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). Figure \ref{fig:retro-squid} shows the change in estimated annual recruitment deviations as subsequent years data are removed during the retrospective run.


### Comparison with Other West Coast Stocks


Copper rockfish is assessed as four distinct stocks off the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California; north of Point Conception in California; Oregon; and Washington. The majority of copper rockfish off the West Coast falls along the California coast with the area north of Point Conception having the largest estimate of unfished spawning ouput.  The stocks off of the Oregon and Washington coast are smaller in size compared to the California stocks with the stock off the coast of Washington estimated to have the smallest unfished spawning output.  Comparison of the estimated spawning output trajectories for the California stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-ca-compare} with Oregon and Washington shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-orwa-compare}.  The fraction unfished across all West Coast stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:depl-compare}. The California stocks are estimated to be the most depleted with the stock south of Point Conception estimated below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished and the stock north of Point Conception estimated to be in the precautionary zone (less that the management target of 40 percent but above the management threshold).  The stock off the coast of Washington is estimated to be just above the management target and the Oregon stock well above the target.

# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were 113.45 mt when using an $\text{SPR}_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was 195.56 million eggs. 

The 2021 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the rockfish relative biomass target of 40 percent but greater that the management limit of 25 percent (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-\text{SPR}$, was above the harvest rate limit ($\text{SPR}_{50\%}$) between the early 1970s and 2009, below the target between 2010 - 2016, and above the target in the final years of the model  (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). In recent years the stock status has been below the management target with the fishing intensity above and below the target in different years (Figure \ref{fig:phase}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.



## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying with $P^*$ = 0.45 combined with the 40-10 harvest control rule (e.g., adjusts the ABC values when a stock in below 40 perfect of unfished) for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). Since the stock is estimated to be below the management target the buffer value in Table \ref{tab:project} reflect both the 40-10 harvest control rule adjustment and the default time-varying scientific uncertainty buffer.

The area assumed in this assessment does not align with the PMFC management regions that define copper rockfish ACL allocation, north and south of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. To determine the amount of the 2021 and 2021 ACL for the California portion of the stock north of Point Conception the total ACL that would be allocated to the state of California was determined by summing the S. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. ACL and the percent of the N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. allocated to California (25 percent, PFMC Groundfish Management team personal communication). This state specific ACL was then split for north and south of Point Conception based on the observed proportion of the catches occurring by area for the most recent 3-year period. The proportion of combined commercial and recreational removals occurring in the region north of Point Conception was 56 percent based on input from the Groundfish Management Team.    

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels to be determined later.


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty


The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the 2021 spawning output is $\sigma$ = 0.31 and the uncertainty in the base model around the 2021 OFL is $\sigma$ = 0.29. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 2 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 1.0. 

## Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for copper rockfish was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Both the recreational and commercial length data indicated that selection of copper rockfish occurs at sizes that were below the length at 50 percent maturity assumed in the base model. Developing area specific estimates of the length- or age-at-maturity of copper rockfish in California waters north of Point Conception would provide additional understanding of the potential impact of size selectivity by each fleet.

	\item Length samples could not be divided between live verus dead copper rockfish within the commercial fishery. This was due to issues with the California data in PacFIN. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landing would allow for future assessments to better account for the range of commercial fishing behavior.

\end{itemize}
