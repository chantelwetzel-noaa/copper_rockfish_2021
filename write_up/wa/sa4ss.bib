	abstract = {The spawning potential ratio (SPR) is a well-established biological reference point, and estimates of SPR could be used to inform management decisions for data-poor fisheries. Simulations were used to investigate the utility of the length-based model (LB-SPR) developed in Hordyk et al. (2015). Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 72: 204–216.) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L∞, and CVL∞). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries.},

	abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys are an important source of information for stock assessment and management worldwide. Research surveys often use trawl gear to capture commercially valuable species and calculate indices of relative abundance or density. However, many species of interest do not occur in direct contact with the bottom, or occur in areas where high-relief habitat precludes trawl operation. This paper introduces a standardized hook and line survey for rockﬁsh conducted by NOAA Fisheries’ Northwest Fisheries Science Center in the Southern California Bight. The survey uses ﬁshing gear similar to that used in many recreational ﬁsheries to sample approximately 120 locations covering a wide range of depths and habitats. To provide an example of how these data can be analyzed for direct inclusion in stock assessments, we standardize catch rates of bocaccio rockﬁsh from 2004–2008 using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model to account for site, ﬁshing time, survey vessel, angler, and other statistically signiﬁcant effects. Results indicate that the bocaccio stock vulnerable to this survey in the Southern California Bight has shown a relatively ﬂat trend over recent years. Length frequency distributions indicate the presence of several strong cohorts that should be detectable in future stock assessments of bocaccio for use in U.S. West Coast groundﬁsh management. This survey is the only available tuning index for the adult portion of the bocaccio population in recent years as historically used recreational catch per unit effort indices have been compromised due to changes in bag limits and other management restrictions.

In the Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council groundﬁsh ﬁshery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help deﬁne stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments deﬁned a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to ﬁsheries. This work uses productivity–susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundﬁsh stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by ﬁrst using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and ﬂexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stockand complex-speciﬁc management.},

We assessed genetic subdivision among ten populations of copper rockﬁsh (Sebastes caurinus) representing paired samples of outer coast and the heads of inlets in ﬁve replicate sounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, using 17 microsatellite DNA loci. Overall, subdivision (FST) was low (FST = 0.031, P {\textless} 0.001), but consistently higher between paired coast and head of inlet sites (mean FST = 0.047, P {\textless} 0.001) compared to among the ﬁve coast sites (mean FST = À0.001, P {\textgreater} 0.5) or among the ﬁve head of inlet sites (mean FST = 0.026, P {\textless} 0.001). Heterozygosity, allelic richness and estimates of effective population size were also lower in head of inlet sites than in coast sites. Bayesian analysis identiﬁed two genetic groups across all samples, a single genetic group among only coast samples, two genetic groups among head of inlet samples and two genetic groups within each sound analysed separately. Head of inlet copper rockﬁsh tended to be shorter with lower condition factors and grew more slowly than coast sites ﬁsh. Reduced physical connectivity and selection against immigrants in contrasting outer coast–head of inlet environments likely contribute to the evolution of population structure of copper rockﬁsh. Based on genetic connectivity, coast sites appear to be better served by existing marine protected areas than are head of inlet sites.},

	abstract = {The copper rockfish is a benthic, nonmigratory, temperate rocky reef marine species with pelagic larvae and juveniles. A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly–spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, CA, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale ({\textasciitilde}2200 km), significant population subdivision (FST = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections ({\textasciitilde}450 km, FST = 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (Nem) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is often seen as a major conservation issue, potentially threatening endangered species and decreasing biodiversity. In natural populations, the conservation implications of hybridization depends on both on anthropogenic factors and the evolutionary processes maintaining the hybrid zone. However, the timeline and patterns of hybridization in the hybrid zone are often not known. Therefore, species conservation becomes a concern when recent anthropogenic changes influence hybridization and not if hybridization is part of a long-term process. Here, we use sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, three nuclear introns and one nuclear exon to estimate the direction, geographic extent, frequency and possible timeline of hybridization between three rockfish species (Sebastes auriculatus, S. caurinus, S. maliger) in the Salish Sea, Washington, USA. We show that (i) introgression occurred much more frequently in the Salish Sea than on the outer coast, (ii) introgression was highly asymmetrical from S. maliger into the other two species, (iii) almost 40\% of individuals in the Salish Sea were hybrids, with frequency of hybrids increasing with isolation from the coast, and (iv) all hybrids were later generation backcrosses rather than F1 hybrids. Our results suggest long-standing lowlevel hybridization rather than recent onset of interbreeding because of human induced environmental change, possibly facilitated by specific environmental conditions in the sub-basins of the Salish Sea, and by differences in population sizes during recolonization of the area after the last glaciation. This rockfish hybrid system, with asymmetrical introgression and the maintenance of parental species, may prove useful to study both mechanisms that maintain species boundaries and that facilitate speciation in the presence of rapid environmental change.},

How individuals use space may also be important to the management of the species and for understanding behavioral processes like optimal foraging or territoriality. We used an acoustic tracking system (VRAP) to examine patterns in home range size and movement behavior for 3 demersal fishes in Puget Sound: lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Data were collected over 8 wk in the summer of 2006 and 3 wk in the winter of 2007. Home ranges were relatively small ({\textasciitilde}1500 to 2500 m2) and did not differ among species. During the summer, lingcod had larger home ranges during the day than at night. Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern. Similar results were seen for quillback rockfish. While the arena of resource management often requires us to simplify complex systems, our results illustrate that such simplification may be difficult, and will depend ultimately on detailed behavioral data.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that inﬂuence larval dispersal and connectivity among marine populations is critical to the conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. We assessed genetic subdivision among ten populations of copper rockﬁsh (Sebastes caurinus) representing paired samples of outer coast and the heads of inlets in ﬁve replicate sounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, using 17 microsatellite DNA loci. Overall, subdivision (FST) was low (FST = 0.031, P {\textless} 0.001), but consistently higher between paired coast and head of inlet sites (mean FST = 0.047, P {\textless} 0.001) compared to among the ﬁve coast sites (mean FST = À0.001, P {\textgreater} 0.5) or among the ﬁve head of inlet sites (mean FST = 0.026, P {\textless} 0.001). Heterozygosity, allelic richness and estimates of effective population size were also lower in head of inlet sites than in coast sites. Bayesian analysis identiﬁed two genetic groups across all samples, a single genetic group among only coast samples, two genetic groups among head of inlet samples and two genetic groups within each sound analysed separately. Head of inlet copper rockﬁsh tended to be shorter with lower condition factors and grew more slowly than coast sites ﬁsh. Reduced physical connectivity and selection against immigrants in contrasting outer coast–head of inlet environments likely contribute to the evolution of population structure of copper rockﬁsh. Based on genetic connectivity, coast sites appear to be better served by existing marine protected areas than are head of inlet sites.},

	abstract = {In order to better assess the ecological importance of offshore petroleum platforms for economically important groundfishes, we quantified the degree of site fidelity of 100 platform-associated individuals representing 15 species at three offshore platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel by means of acoustic telemetry monitoring. Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range ¼ 5–15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of processes underlying recruitment is critical for understanding marine population dynamics and their response to ocean climate. We investigated the relationship between coastal upwelling and early life history of black rockﬁsh (Sebastes melanops), a midwater aggregating species, and CQB rockﬁshes (a solitary benthic species complex including Sebastes caurinus, Sebastes maliger, and Sebastes auriculatus), between two oceanographically distinct years on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. We analysed otolith microstructure to determine parturition and settlement dates, pelagic durations, and preand postsettlement growth rates. High CQB rockﬁsh recruitment in 2005 was associated with prolonged downwelling and warm ocean temperatures, late parturition dates, fast presettlement growth, short pelagic durations, and small size-at-settlement. In contrast, high black rockﬁsh recruitment in 2006 was associated with strong upwelling and cool ocean temperatures, slow presettlement growth, and protracted pelagic durations. Presettlement growth of both rockﬁsh complexes increased with high sea surface temperature, but was unrelated to chlorophyll a concentration. Our results indicate that the same oceanographic conditions give rise to fast presettlement growth and short pelagic durations for both groups, but that different factors lead to strong recruitment in each.},

	abstract = {The estimation of home range size of marine fish has received attention because of its application to the design of marine reserves. How individuals use space may also be important to the management of the species and for understanding behavioral processes like optimal foraging or territoriality. We used an acoustic tracking system (VRAP) to examine patterns in home range size and movement behavior for 3 demersal fishes in Puget Sound: lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Data were collected over 8 wk in the summer of 2006 and 3 wk in the winter of 2007. Home ranges were relatively small ({\textasciitilde}1500 to 2500 m2) and did not differ among species. During the summer, lingcod had larger home ranges during the day than at night. Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern. Similar results were seen for quillback rockfish. While the arena of resource management often requires us to simplify complex systems, our results illustrate that such simplification may be difficult, and will depend ultimately on detailed behavioral data.},

Adults are commonly distributed in temperate coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from British Columbia to southern California, including the inland waterways of Puget Sound, Washington, a semi-enclosed fjord system of known postglacial origin. Here, we report the distribution of genetic variation at six microsatellite DNA loci from six locations throughout the species’ range. Among four coastal samples, significant population subdivision was detected (FST = 0.007), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed. Divergence was large and significant between Puget Sound proper and coastal samples (FST = 0.087). A sample taken only 100 km north of Puget Sound (the Canadian Gulf Islands) was also highly divergent from Puget Sound and coastal samples and was genetically intermediate between the two. The Puget Sound sample also displayed significantly lower allelic diversity and a more substantial presence of private alleles. The patterns of genetic divergence and diversity are most consistent with a historical colonization followed by limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations.},

I present a case study involving an overexploited population of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) on the Chatham Rise, New Zealand. This analysis quantifies the risk to the fishery and shows how this decreases as the rate of reduction in total allowble catch increases. The technique helps fishery managers balance biological risk against economic risk. Ways of generalizing the technique are discussed., Une analyse des risques peut améliorer la valeur des conseils scientifiques fournis à des gestionnaires des pêches parce qu'elle exprime l'incertitude propre aux évaluations de stock en termes de risques biologiques. L'auteur présente une étude de cas portant sur une population surexploitée d'hoplostète orange (Hoplostethus atlanticus) peuplant le massif Chatham, en Nouvelle-Zélande. L'analyse quantifie le risque pour la pêche et montre comment il diminue en fonction d'une augmentation du taux de réduction du total des prises allouées. Cette méthode aidera les gestionnaires des pêches à équilibrer le risque biologique et le risque économique. L'auteur examine aussi divers moyens de généraliser cette méthode.},

Moreover, early life history information is sparse for many species. We used data from 14 microsatellite loci to characterize the genetic structure of young-of-the-year Pacific ocean perch collected during 1998–2003 from the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. Broad-scale geographic variation in genetic structure of the young-of-the-year (FST = 0.005, P {\textless} 10−4) had similarities to that observed in a previous adult study. The overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation by distance) was nearly identical to that observed in the adults. Fine-scale geographic divergence was also observed and may be the result of oceanographic circulation features within the Gulf of Alaska. Interannual variation (between cohorts) at locations sampled in more than one year is consistent with variable oceanography and fine-scale population structure rather than the influence of a sweepstakes effect. The similarities of the young-of-the-year with the adults and the pattern of genetic divergence confirm that dispersal of Pacific ocean perch is limited in all life stages.},

	abstract = {A major clam fishery in the USA is based on the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) and ocean quahog (Arctica islandica). For stock assessment, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has conducted surveys of these species with a standardized hydraulic clam dredge since 1980. The sampling procedure has been to tow the dredge for 5 min at 0.77 m/s (i.e., 1.5 kn), which gives a nominal tow distance of 232 m. This indirect calculation does not include any sampling that may take place when the dredge is being set out or retrieved. To get a direct estimate of distance sampled, we placed sensors and a camera on the dredge to monitor bottom contact and towing speed. A total of 70 tows was made in May 1997 across a range of depths, typical of those made during clam surveys, and at a range of tow speeds and scopes (i.e., ratio of tow line length to bottom depth). For each tow, we counted the number of clams captured and estimated the distance sampled based directly on the sensor data. Actual distance sampled per tow was often 1.5–3 times greater than the nominal distance (timed tow), and tow distance increased with water depth. This occurred because the dredge sampled the bottom when it was being set out and hauled back to the ship. Consideration of actual tow distance changed conclusions regarding the effect of scope on catch rate of surfclams. In addition, data on tow distance and catch per tow allowed us to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the two clam species using a negative binomial model. Our findings suggest that estimating tow distances directly can improve estimates of biomass in clam resource surveys.},

The age-based process caused bias in the estimates of growth parameters assuming random at length, even when relatively few age classes were affected. Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated. Inclusion of paired observations of length and associated age inside the population dynamics model may be the most appropriate way of estimating growth.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fishres.2018.03.014},
	abstract = {Theoretical and applied research suggests that survival rates during early life stages will increase when spawning biomass is reduced in marine ﬁshes (termed “recruitment compensation”). However, the magnitude of recruitment compensation is generally diﬃcult to estimate for individual ﬁsh stocks, and its average value for marine ﬁshes remains highly contested. Scientists and managers for Paciﬁc rockﬁshes (Sebastes spp.) on the US West Coast have used a regional meta-analysis to estimate the likely distribution of the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship using stock assessment models since 2007, and the method has been updated every two years as new assessments are conducted (i.e., ﬁve biennial updates). Here, we provide a short history of this approach, its methodological assumptions, changes in results over time, and ongoing eﬀorts to validate its assumptions. While the regional meta-analysis has been successful in ensuring a consistent approach to treatment of steepness across assessments, the estimates of mean steepness have been unexpectedly variable as the meta-analysis has been updated. Speciﬁcally, we show that the estimated average value of steepness for West Coast rockﬁsh increased markedly from 2007 (average: {\textless} 0.6) to 2011 (average: {\textgreater} 0.75), before decreasing somewhat again in the 2017 update. We also show that this value has a strong impact on rockﬁsh rebuilding plans, and showcase the example of canary and widow rockﬁshes, where the estimated rates of rebuilding are strongly inﬂuenced by the assumed value of steepness. We conclude by discussing the biasvariance tradeoﬀ between using global and regional meta-analysis, as well as the likely implications of diﬃcultto-validate assumptions including: (1) no recruitment autocorrelation within each stock; (2) no correlations among stocks; and (3) no bias from individual stocks resulting from mis-speciﬁcation of the stock assessment models used in the meta-analysis.},

This study presents the ﬁrst bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the California Current and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2–3 years, respectively. The reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase in comparison to most other time series of bomb radiocarbon in marine systems. Upwelling in the California Current produces a lagged rate of increase in radiocarbon levels owing to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to their spending a substantial portion of their ﬁrst year of life in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region and species speciﬁc when possible.},

Sableﬁsh recruitment is related to large-scale climate forcing indexed by regionally correlated sea level (SL) and zooplankton communities that pelagic young-of-the-year sableﬁsh feed upon. This study forecasts trends in future sableﬁsh productivity using SL from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and explores the robustness of harvest control rules (HCRs) to climate driven changes in recruitment using management strategy evaluation (MSE). Future sableﬁsh recruitment is likely to be similar to historical recruitment but may be less variable. Most GCMs suggest that decadal SL trends result in recruitments persisting at lower levels through about 2040 followed by higher levels that are more favorable for sableﬁsh recruitment through 2060. Although this MSE suggests that spawning biomass and catches will decline, and then stabilize, into the future under both HCRs, the sableﬁsh stock does not fall below the stock size that leads to ﬁshery closures.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatiotemporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from prespawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

	abstract = {The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment., An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources., The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-discretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime., In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be possible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time- and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore., More fundamentally, the basic axiom of ‘enlightened self interest’ underlying current methods of management will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive SpatioTemporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatiotemporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Here, we use a simulation framework to show that temporal changes in selectivity, natural mortality, and growth can induce retrospective patterns in integrated, age-structured models. We explore the potential effects on retrospective patterns of catch history patterns, as well as model misspeciﬁcation due to not accounting for time-varying biological parameters and selectivity. We show that non-zero values for Mohn’s r (a common measure for retrospective patterns) can be generated even where there is no model misspeciﬁcation, but the magnitude of Mohn’s r tends to be lower when the model is not misspeciﬁed. The magnitude and sign of Mohn’s r differed among life histories, with different life histories reacting differently from each type of temporal change. The value of Mohn’s r is not related to either the sign or magnitude of bias in the estimate of terminal year biomass. We propose a rule of thumb for values of Mohn’s r which can be used to determine whether a stock assessment shows a retrospective pattern.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of US west coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step towards developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age 1-fish. First, a conceptual life-history approach is used to generate life stage- and spatio-temporally-specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female-spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40-48 °N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (1) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (2) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (3) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (4) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

In this analysis, the reproductive strategy for this species was revisited, fecundity estimates were updated, and size-d­ependent fecundity relationships were established from fish collected off California and the Pacific Northwest. Results of histological analysis indicate that petrale sole exhibit a determinate batch spawning strategy, with potential annual fecundity (PAF) set prior to the release of eggs over the course of several spawning events. Both PAF and relative PAF (weight-s­ pecific fecundity) increased significantly with maternal length and weight. Regional differences in the strength of the relationship between relative PAF and size indicate that the maternal effect is stronger in the Pacific Northwest; however, more data are necessary to confirm regional patterns. Because reproductive output was not proportionate with female size, fisheries managers should consider using relative PAF in determining the reproductive potential of this stock.},

	abstract = {During the past century, commercial fisheries have expanded from small vessels fishing in shallow, coastal habitats to a broad suite of vessels and gears that fish virtually every marine habitat on the globe. Understanding how fisheries have developed in space and time is critical for interpreting and managing the response of ecosystems to the effects of fishing, however time series of spatially explicit data are typically rare. Recently, the 1933–1968 portion of the commercial catch dataset from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife was recovered and digitized, completing the full historical series for both commercial and recreational datasets from 1933–2010. These unique datasets include landing estimates at a coarse 10 by 10 minute ‘‘grid-block’’ spatial resolution and extends the entire length of coastal California up to 180 kilometers from shore. In this study, we focus on the catch history of groundfish which were mapped for each grid-block using the year at 50\% cumulative catch and total historical catch per habitat area. We then constructed generalized linear models to quantify the relationship between spatiotemporal trends in groundfish catches, distance from ports, depth, percentage of days with wind speed over 15 knots, SST and ocean productivity. Our results indicate that over the history of these fisheries, catches have taken place in increasingly deeper habitat, at a greater distance from ports, and in increasingly inclement weather conditions. Understanding spatial development of groundfish fisheries and catches in California are critical for improving population models and for evaluating whether implicit stock assessment model assumptions of relative homogeneity of fisheries removals over time and space are reasonable. This newly reconstructed catch dataset and analysis provides a comprehensive appreciation for the development of groundfish fisheries with respect to commonly assumed trends of global fisheries patterns that are typically constrained by a lack of long-term spatial datasets.},

	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

	abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered ‘populations’. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high (∼100\%; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H0: Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm ≤ 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm ≤ 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

However, management boundaries tend to be static and determined by politically negotiated or historically identiﬁed population (or multi-species) units, which create a potential disconnect with underlying, dynamic population structure. The consequences of incoherent management and population or stock boundaries were explored through the application of a two-area spatial simulation–estimation framework. Results highlight the importance of aligning management assessment areas with underlying population structure and processes, especially when ﬁshing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogenous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments (PSs) compared to assessments that cover a subset of a PS, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between PSs. Directed studies and due consideration of critical PSs, spatially explicit models, and dynamic management options that help align management and population boundaries would likely reduce estimation biases and management risk, as would closely coordinated management that functions across population boundaries.},

	abstract = {Greenstriped rockﬁsh, Sebastes elongatus, are a common commercial and recreational species often taken as bycatch in commercial ﬁsheries off the U.S. west coast. We evaluated weight–length relationships and size-at-age using von Bertalanffy growth models for greenstriped rockﬁsh sampled along the U.S. west coast from 2003 to 2008. Based on regression analyses, populations were subdivided into two depth strata (55–122 m and 122–450 m) and four geographic regions (48◦10 N–48◦28 N, 40◦26 N–48◦10 N, 34◦27 N–40◦26 N, and 32◦30 N–34◦27 N) and differences in length, age, and growth examined by gender. Strong evidence of variation in weight–length relationships was found north and south of Cape Mendocino (40◦26 N) but little variation was noted for depth or gender. In contrast, variations in von Bertalanffy growth models were highly dimorphic between sexes with consistent patterns across depth and geographic regions. Females grew more slowly and reached larger asymptotic sizes (L∞, cm) relative to males in all regions examined. Asymptotic size for both males and females tended to increase at higher latitude and increased depth. However, the smallest asymptotic sizes occurred in the region from Pt. Conception to Cape Mendocino, CA (34◦27 N–40◦26 N), rather than lower latitudes south of Pt. Conception (32◦30 N–34◦27 N). Greenstriped rockﬁsh growth coefﬁcients (k, yr−1) exhibited a more complex pattern. Higher growth coefﬁcients were associated with regions within the northern California Current System characterized by high productivity.},

            Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them. Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size (L∞), with L∞ increasing from south to north. This cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific case of the widely described Bergmann’s rule, and we explore specific potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.},

Copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and lingcod (Ophiodon enlongatus) are dominant members of the typical reef fish community that inhabit rocky and high-relief substrates along the Pacific Northwest. We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study. Our results suggest the potential for artificial reefs to provide rockfish habitat in the event of disturbances to natural habitat.},

	abstract = {Rockfish are an important component of West Coast fisheries and California Current food webs, and recruitment (cohort strength) for rockfish populations has long been characterized as highly variable for most studied populations. Research efforts and fisheries surveys have long sought to provide greater insights on both the environmental drivers, and the fisheries and ecosystem consequences, of this variability. Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winterspawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014–2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events. Species association patterns of pelagic YOY for over 20 rockfish taxa in space and time are also described. The overall results will help inform future fisheries-independent surveys, and will improve future indices of recruitment strength used to inform stock assessment models and marine ecosystem status reports.},

	abstract = {Ignoring spatial population structure in the development of ﬁsheries management advice can aﬀect population resilience and yield. However, the resources required to develop spatial stock assessment models that match the spatial scale of management are often unavailable. As a result, quota recommendations from spatially aggregated assessment models are commonly divided among management areas based on empirical methods. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to 1) explore how variation in population structure inﬂuences the spatial distribution of harvest that produces maximum system yield, and 2) contrast the performance of empirical quota allocation methods in approximating ideal spatial harvest strategies. Spatial scenarios that included post-recruitment movement resulted in a broader range of spatial management options (e.g., setting regional total allowable catch) that achieved near maximum system yield compared to scenarios without movement. Stochastic projections showed that using the proportion of total survey biomass in each management area to spatially allocate quota performed best for maximizing system yield when the true spatial structure was unknown, considerably outperforming equal allocation and allocation based on a recruitment index. However, with all methods, area-speciﬁc harvest rates sometimes led to unintended depletion within management units. Improved data and understanding of spatial stock dynamics can reduce the need for ad hoc approaches for spatial harvest allocation, allow for a greater range of management options, and increase the eﬃcacy of spatial management procedures.},

	abstract = {Some ﬁsh stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in ﬁsh biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while ﬁshing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment conﬁgurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of ﬁshery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting ﬁshery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for ﬁshed areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.},

Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of ‘true’ population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at ﬁner area scales deﬁned by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly deﬁning management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs.},
