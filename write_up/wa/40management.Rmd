## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated ACL for years 2023-2032 with all removals allocated to the recreational fleet (Table \ref{tab:projectionES}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and the percent allocation (26 percent) for Washington state provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT). 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels to be determined later.

## Research and Data Needs

The abiltiy to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data.  Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Continue collecting length samples from recreational catches with an emphasis on increasing annual samples collected.

	\item Collect length data for the commercial fleet if catches occur.

\end{itemize}
