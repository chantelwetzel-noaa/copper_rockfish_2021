This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the US West coast using data through 2020. Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial (mainly in the live-fish fishery) and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring or copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two seperate species (\emph{caurinus} and \emph{vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been deteremined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population sub-division has been detected along the indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Copper rockfish is a relatively long-lived rockfish and have been estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish based on recent productivity susceptibility analaysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Off the coast of Washington copper rockfish is primarily caught in the recreational/sport fishery with very little mortaltiy from commercial fishing. Copper rockfish has been a target of recreational fishing as early as 1934 with catches stabilizing around 2,500 - 3,000 fish per year starting around 1980 with the exception of selected years with high (2005) or low catches (2015).

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) using annual catch limits (ACLs) and overfished limits (OFLS) split North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. Copper rockfish was most recently assessed in 2013 as two stocks, one South of Pt. Conception in California and North to the Washington/Canadian border. The 2013 assessed estimated both areas to be above the management target of 40\% of unfished conditions with the southern area being assessed at 75\% and the northern population at 48\%. The OFLs and the ACLs from each assessed area were modified to match the management boundery of North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In that same issue of \emph{ICES Journal of Marine Science}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} by fitting the one-parameter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), the point estimate for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The above is also the median of the prior. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and SE = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 per year The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values. The oldest aged rockfish was 51 years with two observations, off the coast of Washington and Oregon in 2019. However, age data are subject to ageing error which could impact this estimate of longevity. The selection of 50 years was based on the range of other ages available with multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age and literature examining the longevity of \texttt{spp} {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

The length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington that were collected from 1998-2019 (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). Figure \ref{fig:len-age} shows the lengths and ages for all years by data source as well as predicted von Bertalanffy fits to the data. Females grow larger than males and sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 49.7 cm; $k$ = 0.151

Copper rockfish was last assesseed in 2013 {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2013)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with prior on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, the area South of Pt. Conception off the California coast and the area North of Pt. Conception to the Washington Canada border. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock South of Pt. Conception at 75\% of unfished spawning output North of Pt. Conception at 48\% of unfished spawning output.

The Washington copper rockfish area assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters. The model assumed two fleets: 1) recreational and 2) commercial fleets with recreational removals beginning in 1935. Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within SS for the recreational fleet where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated. The commercial fleet selectivity was assumed to be the same as the recreational fleet due to a lack of length data to estimate a fleet specific selectivity curve. Recruitment was specified to be deterministic due to limited composition data.

The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absense of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

Length compositions from the recreational fleet were fit in the model. In the absense of index or or commercial composition data, no data weighting was performed in the base model. Sensitivities were performed using the three data weighting approaches that are commonly applied for West Coast groundfish stock assessments; Francis method {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Francis and Hilborn 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, McAllister and Ianelli method (also known as Harmonic Mean weighting) {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(McAllister and Ianelli 1997)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and the Dirichlet method {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Thorson et al. 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

There were 3 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and 2 parameters for selectivity (Table \ref{tab:params}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at the mean of the prior. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1} for females and males, which is the median of the prior. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0 and recruitment was assumed deterministic. Maturity-at-length was fixed as described above in Section \ref{maturation-and-fecundity}. Length-weight parameters were fixed at estimates using all length-weight observations described above in Section \ref{length-weight-relationship}. The length-at-age was fixed at sex-specific externally estimated values described above in Section \ref{growth-length-at-age}.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for the recreational fleet. Older and larger copper rockfish may be found deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. However, limited support for dome-shaped selectivity for the recreational fleet was found and the selectivity was fixed to be asmptotic. The commercial selectivity was set equal to the recreational selectivity due to a lack of composition data to support fleet specific estimation.

The base assessment model for copper rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of copper rockfish off the Washington coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 5\%. This was repeated 100 times and a better minimum was not found (Table XXX). The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained above and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian.
