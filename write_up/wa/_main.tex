This assessment reports the status of copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}) off the Washington coast using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from Mexico to Alaska. The core range is comparatively large, from northern Baja Mexico to the Gulf of Alaska, as well as in Puget Sound. Copper rockfish have historically been a part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are commonly found in waters less than 130 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of copper rockfish consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Lea, McAllister, and VenTresca 1999; Bizzarro, Yoklavich, and Wakefield 2017)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring of copper rockfish varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller and Lea 1972)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (\emph{S. caurinus} and \emph{S. vexillaris}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Numerous genetic studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in copper rockfish with variable outcomes. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick, Shurin, and Taylor 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Stocks along the West Coast have not been determined to be genetically distinct populations but significant population subdivision has been detected, indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. A specific study examining copper rockfish populations off the coast of Santa Barbara and Monterey California identified a genetic break between the north and south with moderate differentiation {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Sivasundar and Palumbi 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish are a relatively long-lived rockfish estimated to live at least 50 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Copper rockfish was determined to have the highest vulnerability (V = 2.27) of any West Coast groundfish stock evaluated in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This analysis calculated species-specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history and susceptibility that characterized how the stock could be impacted by fisheries and other activities.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Off the coast of Washington State copper rockfish is primarily caught in the recreational/sport fishery with very little mortality from commercial fishing (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Copper rockfish has been a target of recreational fishing starting as early as 1935, with catches stabilizing around 2,500 - 3,000 fish per year starting around 1980 with the exception of select years with high (2005) or low catches (2015).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish has not been targeted by commercial fisheries in Washington waters. Washington banned commercial fixed gears in 1995 and trawl gear in 1999 in state water, which encompass the vast majority of depths preferred by copper rockfish. In response to the development of the live-fish fishery in California and Oregon, Washington took preemptive action in 1999 to prevent the fishery from developing by prohibiting the landing of live-fish. There are four treaty tribes that fish under separate rules and are not subject to the state water closure. Copper rockfish are usually landed in the Nearshore Rockfish group, a mixed-species market category. Species composition samples were taken from sampled landings, and proportions of copper rockfish reported in the Nearshore market category are estimated by port, quarter, gear, and year. In 2020, COVID-19 closures of tribal lands prevented samplers from accessing all commercial catch, so an average proportion of copper rockfish in 2017 - 2019 was applied to all associated tribal landings.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The primary region of recreational fishing off the Washington coast occurs in the central to northern regions. These areas have rocky habitat with which rockfish species such as copper rockfish are associated, whereas to the southern coast of Washington consists primarily of soft and sandy substrate. The stock off the Washington coast was assessed as a separate stock from other populations off the West Coast based on three factors: 1) suspected limited movement of adult fish between Washington and Oregon given the preferred substrate separation, 2) the different exploitation patterns within Washington waters compared to Oregon and California, and 3) the quantity of length data in Washington compared to other areas.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Copper rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes, split at 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. N. off the West Coast. Each complex, comprised of nearshore rockfish species, is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catch) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex (North or South). Removals for species within the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complexes are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Table \ref{tab:ofl} show the Nearshore Rockfish North complex level OFLs and ACLs, the copper rockfish OFL and ACL contribution amounts, the state-specific allocations (26 percent for Washington, Groundfish Management Team, personal communication) applied to the copper rockfish ACL contribution, and the total removals in Washington.

There are very limited commercial fishery removals of copper rockfish off the Washington coast (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Across all model years there were less than 2 mt removed by the commercial fishery. The commercial catches were provided directly by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). Given the limited observed removals by the commercial fleet, the historical discards (discards prior to 2002) were assumed to be nominal and were not accounted for in the model. In recent years, 2002-2019, the coastwide discards observed by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP) were attributed to each state based on the proportion of commercial removals by state. The commercial discards allocated to Washington were relatively minor (less than 0.02 mt total since 2002). There were no length data available for copper rockfish in Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) for use in this assessment.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Recreational removals in the model begin in 1935 and are the primary source of fishing mortality for copper rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Removals were specified in numbers of fish (1,000s) and were converted to metric tons internally to the model (Table \ref{tab:nums-mt}). Annual catches (in numbers) from the recreational fishery (1967, 1975-1980) were obtained from historical reports, and landings from 1990-2020 were obtained from WDFW Ocean Sampling Program (OSP) and Puget Sound Baseline Sampling Program (Puget Sound copper rockfish samples not included in the data). To fill in the missing years, linear interpolations were used to find landed values between 1968 and 1974, and to bring catch down to zero in year 1934. Discard estimates are not available prior to 2002. Historical discards were estimated based on a discard to retained catch relationship from 2002 - 2020. Discard mortality by depth was applied to post-2001 discards estimate. Prior to 2002, a 31 percent mortality rate is applied to all discarded fish. The sum of retained and dead released copper rockfish made up the total removal (in numbers) from the recreational fishery. The recreational removals generally increased over time, spiked in 2005 to an all-time high, and since have been roughly between 1,000 and 3,000 fish per year.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Length compositions for the recreational fleet were available in 1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, and then each year from 1995 - 2020 (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}). The number of length observations by year were quite variable ranging between 3 - 463 samples per year (Figure \ref{fig:wa-len-data}). The size of sexed and unsexed fish observed by the recreational fleet were primarily between 30 - 45 cm (Figure \ref{fig:wa-len-agg}). The mean length observed by year had limited variation with year with a marginally smaller mean length between 35 - 40 cm until 2010 after which the mean length increased slightly to range around 40 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-len-data}).

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The current method for developing a prior on natural mortality for West Coast groundfish stock assessments is based on Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} rate to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This approach modifies work done by Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} who estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M = 4.899A^{-0.916}_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Hamel (personal communication) re-evaluated the data used by Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} by fitting the one-parameter {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hamel 2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}), the point estimate and median of the prior for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

where {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A_{\text{max}}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is the maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and standard error = 0.438. Using a maximum age of 50, the point estimate and median of the prior is 0.108 yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The maximum age was selected based on available age data from all West Coast data sources and literature values. The oldest aged copper rockfish was 51 years with two observations, one each off of the coast of Washington and Oregon in 2019. The maximum age in the model was set at 50 years. This selection was consistent with the literature examining the longevity of copper rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love 1996)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and was supported by the observed ages which had multiple observations of fish between 44 and 51 years of age.

The length-weight relationship for copper rockfish was estimated outside the model using all coastwide biological data available from fishery-independent data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the NWFSC Hook and Line survey (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-survey}). The estimated length-weight relationship for female fish was W = 9.56e-06{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}\textsuperscript{3.19} and males 1.08e-05{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}\textsuperscript{3.15} where {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is length in cm and W is weight in kilograms (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Length-at-age was estimated for male and female copper rockfish using data collected from fishery-dependent data sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington, collected between 1998-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}). The available fishery-dependent data from Oregon and Washington included limited observations of young fish (less than 4 years of age) which presented challenges for estimating growth. Attempting to estimate growth in the absence of data to inform the rate of growth ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) and the size-at-age 0 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(t_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) could result in biased estimates of all parameters including the size-at-maximum length ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). A published growth study for copper rockfish by Lea {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1999)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} had numerous observations of young fish and also reported the mean length, the number of observations, and the standard deviation of the length observations by age. These pieces of information were used to simulate length-at-age data that would be representative of the study's data for fish less than 5 years of age. The simulated data for young fish appeared consistent with older fish observed off the Oregon and Washington coast (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). This combined data set was used to estimate growth curves for male and female copper rockfish that were used in this assessment. Ideally, growth would be estimated using data collected from similar sources. However, the bias from using data from different sources was considered to be less than the bias that may arise from estimating growth from observations that did not cover the range of ages.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The estimated growth used in this assessment had females reach marginally larger asymptotic sizes compared to males. Sex-specific growth parameters were estimated at the following values:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 48.4 cm; $k$ = 0.206

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 47.2 cm; $k$ = 0.231

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

These values were fixed within the base model for male and female copper rockfish. While the growth differences between sexes was limited for copper rockfish, sex-specific parameterization was used in the hopes that it would allow the length data to the most informative within the assessment. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age by sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.

For the sake of parsimony, the length-age samples were pooled across sources to estimate a single length-at-age curve for copper rockfish in California north of Point Conception, Oregon, and Washington. In the future, if adequate area based length-age samples across a range of fishery-dependent and -independent source are available, copper rockfish growth should be re-evaluated for possible area-specific variation.

The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with priors on select parameters: natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity. Copper rockfish was assessed as two separated stocks, the area south of Point Conception off the California coast and the area north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border.

A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured to include the area from north of Point Conception to the Washington/Canadian border. The data types used in the 2013 assessment were catches and indices of abundance. Matching the 2013 data was not straight forward based aside from the challenges already posed from the alternative model platform (XDB-SRA) and area grouping. First, the 2013 assessment document did not report catches on a state and source level (not atypical for grouped state or area assessment). Secondly, some of the recreational indices used in 2013 were calculated based on multi-state data. All of these items created significant challenges of how to conduct an effective, logical, and informative bridging analysis for the assessment north of Point Conception.

The assessment of copper rockfish in Washington waters was assessed using a two-sex model with sex specific life history parameters. The model assumed two fleets: 1) recreational and 2) commercial fleets with recreational removals beginning in 1935. Selectivity was specified using the double normal parameterization within Stock Synthesis for the recreational fleet where selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated. The commercial fleet selectivity was assumed to be the same as the recreational fleet due to a lack of length data to estimate a fleet specific selectivity curve. The commercial and recreational fleets were kept separate in the model despite the limited commercial removals and composition data for two reasons: 1) clarity and 2) the recreational fleet removals were specified in terms of numbers while the commercial removals were in biomass. Recruitment was specified to be deterministic due to limited composition data.

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 50 years.

However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95.

Older and larger copper rockfish may be found deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. However, limited support for dome-shaped selectivity for the recreational fleet was found and the selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the recreational fleet. The Pearson residuals show a pattern of greater observations of all sexes (unsexed, males, and females) that start around 1995 and appear to move through the length data by year, possibly indicating a strong or multiple strong recruitments entering the population (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Estimating annual recruitment deviations would have allowed the model to fit the patterns in the length data. However, the base model did not estimate annual recruitment deviations due to limited length data which resulted in extreme recruitment deviation estimates (large positive deviations in the 1990s followed by string of negative deviations from 2000 - 2020) resulting in a highly pessimistic stock status (see Section \ref{sens}). The assessment of copper rockfish off the Oregon coast which also did not include annual recruitment deviations had similar indications in the data of one or more strong year classes in the mid-1990s indicating that oceanographic forces driving recruitment success or failure may be shared across Oregon and Washington. The mean lengths across years with data was relatively stable ranging roughly between 35 and 42 cm by year (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Detailed fits to the length data by year are provided in the Appendix, Section \ref{length-fit}. Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. There are a few things that stand out when examining the aggregated length composition data. The estimated fits to the data by sex matches the general shape of the aggregated lengths. However, the model expects a higher proportion of the largest fish relative to the data. This may indicate that the true selectivity of the recreational fleet may have some level of reduced selectivity of the largest fish (dome-shaped) but the selectivity in the model was fixed to be asymptotic to follow the pre-specified terms of reference for a length-based assessment which specifies that at least one fleet in the model should have asymptotic selectivity. Sensitivities examining dome-shaped and estimating annual recruitment deviations were performed and presented in the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{sensitivity-analyses}{Sensitivity Analyses}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} section below.

A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.

The two sensitivities that had the largest impact relative to the base model were the ones that estimated annual recruitment deviations alone or combined to also estimate dome-shaped selectivity (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}). The time series of each of these sensitivities resulted in large scale swings in spawning output across time. The estimates or recruitment deviations had a string of average estimates during the late 1990s and early 2000s then switching to a period of low recruitment success in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:sens-recr}). The recruitment deviation estimates were likely being driven by subtle shifts in the mean lengths being observed across time (Figure \ref{fig:mean-len-data}). The pattern of recruitment deviations estimated was extreme for the Washington area model but the general pattern showed some coherence with the recruitment deviations peaks estimated in the separate Oregon area model (shown as a sensitivity). The sensitivity in the Oregon model that estimated recruitment deviations also estimated above average recruitment in the late 1990s which led to an increase in spawning output during the 2000s similar to what was observed in this sensitivity for the Washington model. This may indicate that copper rockfish off the coast of Oregon and Washington experience similar drivers in recruitment.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

A sensitivity run allowing dome-shaped selectivity with deterministic recruitment was also performed but not shown here due to the model failing to estimate a reasonable biomass scale (hit the upper bound of log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) of 20).

The sensitivities exploring data weighting using the Francis or MI methods matched the base model as expected given that there was only one source of data used in the model.

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis using the approach developed by Hordyk et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} was conducted. This approach assumes asymptotic selectivity and deterministic recruitment to produce independent estimates by year of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort based on the observed recreational lengths. This analysis indicated that copper rockfish were 50 percent selected generally between 30 - 35 cm (excluding 2018) with full selection between 35 - 40 cm (Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). The median estimates of SPR by year ranged between 0.60 - 0.75 between 2016 - 2019 with an average of the medians of 0.67. This type of analysis can provide insight on the fishing effort based on life history and observed length data in the absence of an integrated assessment model.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

An additional analysis to estimate stock status based on length data alone was conducted within a length only version of Stock Synthesis. Within this approach the removal history is removed but the same life history values, selectivities, and length compositions (both sexed and unsexed) are used. The underlying assumption is that the population has gone through an aggregate constant catch and constant recruitment in order to get an estimate of the current stock status. Length compositions are fit by estimating the parameter log({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) (considered a nuisance parameter) which allows for best fits to the length comps and the selectivity by fleet. Using the recreational lengths, the estimated logistic selectivity, and life history from the Washington base model the implied stock status in 2020 was estimated to be approximately 0.44.

A SSS was run to compare the results from the base model with a simpler modeling approach. SSS samples via Monte Carlo from three key parameter distributions: natural mortality, steepness, and stock status in a specific year. The mean and median of the priors assumed in the base model were used to create sampling distributions for natural mortality and steepness. Two alternative assumptions regarding the distribution of current stock status were explored. SSS applies parameter draws from each of the three parameters within the model and then estimates an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} value based on the fixed removals and drawn parameters.

The prior distribution for parameters and the derived quantities with 95 percent uncertainty are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sss-prior-67} and \ref{fig:sss-quant-67}. Assuming that the stock was less depleted relative to the base model resulted in higher estimates of the OFL and ABC in 2023, even when the category 3 buffer was applied (buffer = 0.778, based on a P* = 0.45 and \sigma = 2.0).

Copper rockfish is assessed as four distinct stocks off the U.S. west coast: south of Point Conception in California; north of Point Conception in California; Oregon; and Washington. The area north of Point Conception off the coast of California was estimated to have the largest unfished spawning output of copper rockfish off the West Coast. The stocks off of the Oregon and Washington coast are smaller in size compared to the California stocks with the stock off the coast of Washington estimated to have the smallest unfished spawning output. Comparison of the estimated spawning output trajectories for the California stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-ca-compare} with Oregon and Washington shown in Figure \ref{fig:ssb-orwa-compare}. The fraction unfished across all West Coast stocks are shown in Figure \ref{fig:depl-compare}. The California stocks are estimated to be the most depleted with the stock south of Point Conception estimated below the management threshold of 25 percent of unfished and the stock north of Point Conception estimated to be in the precautionary zone (less that the management target of 40 percent but above the management threshold). The stock off the coast of Washington is estimated to be just above the management target and the Oregon stock well above the target.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). The estimated sustainable total yields are estimated to be 2.24 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of unfished ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SB}_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was estimated to be 3.41 million eggs.

The spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium in 2021 is estimated to be above the management target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (42 percent, Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-\text{SPR}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has been above and below the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\text{SPR}_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) in recent years (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}).

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge our survey team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. Peter Frey and John Harms were incredibly helpful in helping the STAT team to understand the data and as to why and when each of our assessments either encounter or do not copper rockfish along the coast. Melissa Head provided an area specific maturity estimate for copper rockfish and provided insight in the complex biological processes that govern maturity processes.

All of the data-moderate assessment assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, Bill James, and Daniel Platt provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the copper rockfish assessments conducted this year.
