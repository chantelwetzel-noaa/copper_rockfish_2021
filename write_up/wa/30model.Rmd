# Assessment Model

## Summary of Previous Assessments 

`r Spp` was last assesseed in 2013 [@cope_data-moderate_2013]. The stock was assessed using extended depletion-based stock reduction analysis (XDB-SRA) a data-moderate approach which incorporated catch and index data with prior on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity). `r Spp` was assessed as two separated stocks, the area South of Pt. Conception off the California coast and the area North of Pt. Conception to the Washington Canada border. The 2013 assessment estimated the stock South of Pt. Conception at 75% of unfished spawning output North of Pt. Conception at 48% of unfished spawning output.
