## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 10%. This was repeated 100 times with 94 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability, although much of the early model investigation was done without attempting to estimate a Hessian. 

### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The majority of the sensitivities conducted was a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Estimate female natural mortality ($M$).
  
  \item Estimate female growth coefficient ($k$).

  \item Estimate female $L_{\infty}$. 
    
  \item Estimate annual recruitment deviations. 

  \item Estimate annual recruitment deviations while allowing for a dome-shaped selectivity curve. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli (MI) method using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 

  \item Data weighting according to the Francis method using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) method where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}.  Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}.

The two sensitivities that had the largest impact relative to the base model were the ones that estimated annual recruitment deviations alone or combined to estimate dome-shaped selectivity (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}).  The time series of each of these sensitivities resulted in large scale swings in spawning output across time.  The estimates or recruitment deviations where above average during the late 1990s and early 2000s switching to a period of low recruitment success in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:sens-recr}) which are likely being driven by subtle shifts in the mean lengths being observed across time (Figure \ref{fig:mean-len-data}). The model did estimate dome-shaped selectivity when allowed to when recruitment deviations were also estimated.  A sensitivity run allowing dome-shaped selectivity alone was performed but not shown here because the model failed to estimate a reasonable biomass scale (hit the upper bound of log($R_0$)). 

The sensitivities exploring data weighting using the Francis or MI methods matched the base model as expected given that there was only one source of data used in the model. In contrast, the DM method resulted in a stock size and status less than the base model.  It is unclear why this difference in results across data weighting arose.  


### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, maximum length, and female natural mortality values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value.

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at approximately log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). Increasing the $R_0$, relative to the value estimated, results in an increase in stock scale and status (Figures \ref{fig:r0-ssb} and \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, the negative log-likelihood supported values at the upper bound of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}).  Assuming higher or lower steepness values impacted the estimated unfished spawning output but had less impact on the final spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status ranged between around the minimum threshold (0.25) to above the management target depending upon assuming a lower or higher steepness value (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across female natural mortality supported values greater than the fixed value of `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` (Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The estimate stock trajectories assuming lower or higher natural mortality values impacted the estimated unfished spawning output and resulted in stock statuses within the management precautionary zone (between 0.25 - 0.40) and above (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb} and  \ref{fig:m-depl}). 

A profile across a range of female $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}).  The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between 46 and 47 cm. The $L_{\infty}$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` based on length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status is quite variable across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb} and \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

A profile across a range of female $k$ values was also conducted (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile}).  The negative log-likelihood showed support for values between 0.11 and 0.13. The $k$ value for female fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` based on length-at-age data collected off the Oregon and Washington coast. The stock scale and status increases under lower $k$ values where assuming higher values resulted in decreases in stock scale and status (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb} and \ref{fig:k-depl}).

### Length-Based Spawner-per-Recruit Analysis

An exploratory length-based spawner-per-recruit analysis which assumes asymptotic selectivity estimating year independent estimates of selectivity and spawner-per-recruit (SPR) effort on the recreational lengths. This analysis indicated the `r spp` were 50 percent selected size around 30 - 35 cm (excluding 2018) with full selection between 35 - 40 cm  (Figure \ref{fig:lbspr}). The median estimates of SPR by year ranged between 0.60 - 0.80 between 2016 - 2020. 

### Simple Stock Synthesis

A Simple Stock Sythesis (SSS) was run to compare the results from the base model with a simpler modeling approach.  SSS samples via Monte Carlo from three key parameter distributions: natural mortality, steepness, and stock status in a specific year.  The mean and median of the priors assumed in the base model were used to create sampling distributions for natural mortality and steepness.  Two alternative assumptions regarding the distribution of current stock status were explored. SSS applies parameter draws from each of the three parameters within the model and then estimates an $R0$ value based on the fixed removals and drawn parameters.   

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Current stock status based on the estimate from the SS-CL model:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of draws = 1000,
		\item $M$ = lognormal distrubtion (0.108, 0.22),
		\item $h$ = truncated beta (0.72, 0.15), and
		\item current stock status = beta(0.40, 0.20)
	\end{itemize}	  
	\item Current stock status based on LB-SPR estimates: 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of draws = 1000,
		\item $M$ = lognormal distrubtion (0.108, 0.22),
		\item $h$ = truncated beta (0.72, 0.15), and
		\item current stock status = beta(0.60, 0.20)	
	\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}



### Retrospective Analysis
A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data only through 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The estimated spawning output was consistent with the base model when recent year's data were removed up until 4 and 5 years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). Removing this amount of data resulted in a downward shift in stock scale and status.
