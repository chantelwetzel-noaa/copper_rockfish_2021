	abstract = {The Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires active management of all stocks at risk of overﬁshing or otherwise in need of conservation and management. In the Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council groundﬁsh ﬁshery management plan, about two-thirds of the more than 90 managed stocks are currently without traditional assessments to help deﬁne stock status in relation to management targets. Stock complexes are often employed for management purposes in such situations. The guidelines issued in response to the 2006 MSA amendments deﬁned a complex as a group of stocks with similar geographic distributions, life histories, and vulnerabilities to ﬁsheries. This work uses productivity–susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundﬁsh stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by ﬁrst using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and ﬂexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stockand complex-speciﬁc management.},

Head of inlet copper rockﬁsh tended to be shorter with lower condition factors and grew more slowly than coast sites ﬁsh. Reduced physical connectivity and selection against immigrants in contrasting outer coast–head of inlet environments likely contribute to the evolution of population structure of copper rockﬁsh.

	abstract = {The copper rockfish is a benthic, nonmigratory, temperate rocky reef marine species with pelagic larvae and juveniles. A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly–spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, CA, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale ({\textasciitilde}2200 km), significant population subdivision (FST = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections ({\textasciitilde}450 km, FST = 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (Nem) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.},

	abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is often seen as a major conservation issue, potentially threatening endangered species and decreasing biodiversity. In natural populations, the conservation implications of hybridization depends on both on anthropogenic factors and the evolutionary processes maintaining the hybrid zone. However, the timeline and patterns of hybridization in the hybrid zone are often not known. Therefore, species conservation becomes a concern when recent anthropogenic changes influence hybridization and not if hybridization is part of a long-term process. Here, we use sequence data from one mitochondrial gene, three nuclear introns and one nuclear exon to estimate the direction, geographic extent, frequency and possible timeline of hybridization between three rockfish species (Sebastes auriculatus, S. caurinus, S. maliger) in the Salish Sea, Washington, USA. We show that (i) introgression occurred much more frequently in the Salish Sea than on the outer coast, (ii) introgression was highly asymmetrical from S. maliger into the other two species, (iii) almost 40\% of individuals in the Salish Sea were hybrids, with frequency of hybrids increasing with isolation from the coast, and (iv) all hybrids were later generation backcrosses rather than F1 hybrids. Our results suggest long-standing lowlevel hybridization rather than recent onset of interbreeding because of human induced environmental change, possibly facilitated by specific environmental conditions in the sub-basins of the Salish Sea, and by differences in population sizes during recolonization of the area after the last glaciation. This rockfish hybrid system, with asymmetrical introgression and the maintenance of parental species, may prove useful to study both mechanisms that maintain species boundaries and that facilitate speciation in the presence of rapid environmental change.},

Movement in all 3 species was in some way related to diel and tidal cycles, although individuals within species differed, and there was no general pattern. About half of the lingcod used portions of their home ranges only during the day and on the flood tide. Other individuals made similar movements on the ebb tide. Some copper rockfish moved to specific areas of their home range on the day ebb tide, while others made these movements on the night flood tide; others showed no pattern.

Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range ¼ 5–15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs.},

We investigated the relationship between coastal upwelling and early life history of black rockﬁsh (Sebastes melanops), a midwater aggregating species, and CQB rockﬁshes (a solitary benthic species complex including Sebastes caurinus, Sebastes maliger, and Sebastes auriculatus), between two oceanographically distinct years on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. We analysed otolith microstructure to determine parturition and settlement dates, pelagic durations, and preand postsettlement growth rates. High CQB rockﬁsh recruitment in 2005 was associated with prolonged downwelling and warm ocean temperatures, late parturition dates, fast presettlement growth, short pelagic durations, and small size-at-settlement. In contrast, high black rockﬁsh recruitment in 2006 was associated with strong upwelling and cool ocean temperatures, slow presettlement growth, and protracted pelagic durations. Presettlement growth of both rockﬁsh complexes increased with high sea surface temperature, but was unrelated to chlorophyll a concentration. Our results indicate that the same oceanographic conditions give rise to fast presettlement growth and short pelagic durations for both groups, but that different factors lead to strong recruitment in each.},

	abstract = {The copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) is a benthic, nonmigratory, rocky reef species with pelagic larval and juvenile stages lasting several months. Adults are commonly distributed in temperate coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean from British Columbia to southern California, including the inland waterways of Puget Sound, Washington, a semi-enclosed fjord system of known postglacial origin. Here, we report the distribution of genetic variation at six microsatellite DNA loci from six locations throughout the species’ range. Among four coastal samples, significant population subdivision was detected (FST = 0.007), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed. Divergence was large and significant between Puget Sound proper and coastal samples (FST = 0.087). A sample taken only 100 km north of Puget Sound (the Canadian Gulf Islands) was also highly divergent from Puget Sound and coastal samples and was genetically intermediate between the two. The Puget Sound sample also displayed significantly lower allelic diversity and a more substantial presence of private alleles. The patterns of genetic divergence and diversity are most consistent with a historical colonization followed by limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations.},
