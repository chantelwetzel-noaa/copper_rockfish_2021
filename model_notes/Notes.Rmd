# Model Meeting 12.17.2020

## Copper rockfish

### South of Pt. Conception
- Examining model "7.1_data_rec_len_add_trawl" which has Linf and maturity fixed at coastwide values.
- Changing Linf and Maturity strongly impacts how pessimistic stock status is.
- Recreational selectivity being estimated as selecting small fish, less that the 50% maturity size, and dome shaped.  The dome is exploratory and may be pinned to be asymptotic later.
- The bump up in the time series around 2015 is due to recruitment with a series of positive devs from 2008-2014. Without rec devs the fits to the lengths really degrades and over-estimates the mean length by year.
- HKL index fairly noisy or/and uninformative but the length data from this fleet are showing that the larger fish are out there.
- This model is applying francis data weighting
- The trawl survey is just there and data are not fit well.

To Do
- Explore starting from a more drastic rec dome to see if estimation changes.
- Email Gerry

### North of Pt. Conception
- Examing model "5.1_data_rec_len_trawl_survey"
- Blocked commercial selectivity shifting to smaller fish in recent years (2009+). The change in mean length was not able to be explained fully due to strong recruitment.
- Really clear evidence of a strong ~2008 recruitment and without devs poor mean length fits and residual patterns. However, the size of the rec dev in ~2008 is resulting in a strong uptick of the stock (above target) and without in the precautionary zone.
- DM data weighting

To Do
- Shorten the rec devs time series.

### Oregon
- Examining model "2.4_recdevs_early_est_p1_only_block"
- Recreational selectivity blocked periods: start - 1999 and 2000 - end.
- Released fish - I had not initially included these lengths (I think I looked at the CA released lengths which were really small) but adding these few lengths in as a ghost fleet show that they are not really different from the retained fish (when there are more than a few samples in a year). We should talk with Ali more about why an angler would release a fish on a trip.
- There does not seem to be enough information to estimate rec devs however without devs the stock is estimated unfished with a large R0 and with devs on estimated in the precautionary zone with a much more reasonable R0.

To Do
- Remove block for the current model.
- Add age data and see how the recruitment changes.
- Check log(R0) black rockfish, china - central ~4.5, china north ~3.5, and blue rockfish.

### Washington
- Looking at a model without rec devs "5.1.1_selex_cv_fixed"
- While allowing domed-selectivity there is likely little impact of this and will likely be pinned asymptotic.
- Estimating rec devs vs. not results in fairly dramatic model differences.  The rec devs are likely being driven entirely by the catches rather than information in the lengths. When estimating rec devs there are some very large series of recruitment around 2000 and then all negative for the years after. There is a trade-off between recruitment and selectivity where: No devs -> left shifted selectivity, Rec devs -> right shifted selectivity
- Apply francis data weighting.

<!-- ## Quillback rockfish -->

<!-- ### California -->
<!-- - Period of high recruitment in the 1990s followed by a dip in recent years.  These patterns appear to be really driven by the catch.   -->
<!-- - Possible sensitivity - apply a smoother through the catch time series and evaluate what the model does to recruitment. In theory, the removals should be similar applying a smoother but would allow you to possibly decouple recruitment and catches. -->


<!-- ### Oregon -->
<!-- - Seeing really large recruitment around 1997 and again possibly around 2013 which are supported by the length data. -->

<!-- ### Washington -->

<!-- - Recruitment devs appear to be tracking catches with catches spiking in select years.  -->
<!-- - Francis and MI data weighting has been explored so far, but not DM yet. -->
<!-- - The recruitment deviations are likely also being driven by an increase in mean lengths in recent years which the model is explaining by having a string of negative recruitments.  -->


## Squarespot rockfish
- Examining model "2.4_rec_devs_2010"
- Max age set at 34 based on 95% quantile of ages
- Tried restricting rec dev estimates to only the recent years based on some estimates in early years that look uninformed. The challenge of estimation here appears to be that we don't see small incoming fish (likely because they are small even when "grown"), however, the does appear to be a change in the population based on the hkl index and a slight change in mean length between 2016-2018. Without rec devs the model estimates a fairly unfished stock up until recent years where catches have spiked which does not fit the hkl index (flat line).
- NWFSC HKL index shows a sharp increase between 2015-2018
- Francis weighting applied so far (not re-weighted with the most recent runs).
- No rec devs: R0 = 6.6, SB0 = 40.9, Depl 2021 = 0.65, Catch spr = 20.8 mt
- Only recent devs: R0 = 5.5, SB0 = 13.1, Depl 2021 = 4.8, Catch spr = 6.9 mt

To Do
- Double or triple the lambda on the composition data.
- Try the DM
- Change the min max rec devs allowed in the ctl
- Reduce sigma R back to 0.60.

# Model Meeting 1.5.2020

## Copper rockfish

### South of Pt. Conception

- The recreational data and the NWFSC Hook and Line data seem to represent seperate sections of the population. The area of the survey is a location that likely gets little recreational fishing due to travel time from shore.  The recreational data indicates a very depleted stock, while the survey data indicates a "healthy" stock.
    - Put more weight on survey data and less on recreational data (MI) with dome shaped selectivity ~ 25%.
    - Put more weight on survey data and less on recreational data (MI) with asymptotic selectivity ~8%.
    - Put more weight on recreational data and less on survey data (francis) with dome shaped selectivity ~8%.
    - Put more weigth on recreational data and less on survey data (francis) with asymptotic shaped selectivity ~3%.
- Early commercial lengths mean lengths are a fair amount greater than expected.  These years have limited sample sizes (1983 - 1994, 9 years total).

- To Do:
	- If we think HKL is not representative of the population then we should not be using it to be representative.
	- If we assume that the HKL is representative of the population, how do we get the recreational flee and the survey to agree.  Profile across the p6 parameter determine where they depart. Create two seperate models 1) hook & line only and 2) recreational only. How severe does the dome shape need to be for the recreational model match the hkl model? Running the rec model only will the easier one. Questions to ask 1) what does the rec devs look like without hkl data?


### North of Pt. Conception

- "Base" model (9.0_base)
- Block in recreational selectivity with a right shifted peak through 2008. Both periods are asymptotic.
- Recruitment deviations estimated.  Considerable adjustment in the main vs. early start years was needed due to a series of negative rec devs at the start of the initial main years which resulted in even higher positive rec devs later on.  The key was removing the early recreational length (1983-1986, 4 years total). The fish observed during this period were greater than all other years which led to the model estimated recruitment failures preceeding the start of the data.  An alternative if these data are to be believed would be to implement a block in selectivity.

- To Do
	- Block in early recreational selectivity based on the currently removed data.
	- Do additional explorations to understand the influence of the commercial data. Could do the lamdbad to reduce the influence of these data. Also, look at fixing late block to match early block and/or look at the selectivity for the unblocked model.

### Oregon

- "Base" model (5.5_dw_francis_sigmar_60)
- Block on recreational selectivity with asymptotic selectivity through 1999 with domed selectivity in the period after 1999.
- Estimate recruitment deviations with the main period starting in 1980.
- Francis data weighting with sigma R = 0.90 vs. sigma R = 0.60 are similar but better NLL with sigma R = 0.90 by ~ 3 units. In contrast the MIdata weightin under the two sigma R assumptions results in very different model results. Dirichlet data weighting is dramatically different relative to the other two methods.
- There seems to be some tension between commercial and rec lengths in terms of R0 which data weighting highlights.

### Washington

- "Base" model (7.0_base) estimates asymptotic recreational selectivity with commercial selectivity mirrored. Recruitment is assumed deterministic due to limited data but a sensitivity is performed.  Estimated parameters R0, selectivity peak, and selectivity ascending slope.

## Squarespot rockfish

- Model "2.5_rec_devs_sigmaR60"
- Need to explore rec dev periods.  All rec devs are being estimated as part of the "main" period.

## Quillback rockfish

### California
- Surprisingly recdevs are not connected to catch as much as I thought
- [compare_catch_rec.R](https://github.com/brianlangseth-NOAA/quillback_rockfish_2021/blob/master/code/compare_catch_rec.R) is a simple function that plots catches with recruits with option for offset and catches aren't as connected

![simple model with recdevs estimated.\label{fig:catch-rec-ca}](//nwcfile/FRAM/Assessments/CurrentAssessments/DataModerate_2021/Quillback_Rockfish/models/ca/1_0_0_recdevs/compare_catch_rec.png){width=50% height=50%}

- Better to use rdevs instead of recruits?
- Using a 7-yr moving average of catches also doesn't affect model like I thought it would

### Oregon

### Washington

A few things to discuss

1. Rec bias adjustment - Do you iterate with SS_fitbiasramp()? There is some osciallation with 116 models

2. Rec devs - General tips on when to start? Whether to include early rec devs at all?

![Comparing influence of rec devs and sigmaR.\label{fig:rec-ca}](//nwcfile/FRAM/Assessments/CurrentAssessments/DataModerate_2021/Quillback_Rockfish/models/wa/plots/3_rec_SSplotComparisons_31-Dec-2020_15.03_Page_15.png){width=50% height=50%}

3. Sigma R - WA models do run high. Estimating is unreasonable in my opinion (keeps hitting whatever bound is set. Ive gone up to 1.2). Higher sigmaR reduces rec magnitude (reduces R0). Right now Im going with 0.9 but no real basis for choice.

4. Dome shaped selectivity - Just allow estimation of p6? For me effect is not large (dome is at higher high lengths - and actually above my data bins). Washington didn't have obvious choice.

5. Ages - I added ages into my WA model. Then reweighted. Results are very odd. Thoughts on keeping ages

- Ages only for 1998, 1999, 2000

- Add lots of early meaningful recdevs

- Weighting removes any information on mean length but fits age comps much better

# Model Meeting 1.21.2020

## Quillback rockfish

### Washington

- "Base" model (6_0_base)
- Base does not have recdevs for a number of reasons. 
- Model suggests population is low. A bit surprising given relatively low fishing pressure. High age, and possibly
limited habitat could cause such a condition so its possible. 
- Recdevs high early, low recent: driven by lack of small fish and increasing mean size in later years. Selectivity is right shifted too.
- Very similar to copper patters in sel, recdevs, comps
- Continued evidence for sigmaR = 0.9 but not doing. Only reason is that it "seems" large. Where to explore what is reasonable?
- Getting warnings "warning: poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.0014869" How big of issue?
- Jitter shows 3/100 runs are way off, 2/100 slightly off 
- Choice of data weighting makes moderate difference. Interesting to think of when have such limited data to weight.

### Oregon

- "Base" model (3_0_base)
- Includes recdevs, includes block starting at 1999
- Very strong recruitment pulses driven by comps. 2012 pulse driven by most recent years, in both rec and comm. Other pulses evident in compositions across years. 2012 pulse "saves" population (i.e. removing 2017-2020 comps cause population to decline) seen below and in retro plot

- Given strong recruitment in 1990s, population turns around dramatically. Is this reasonable for a population living to 90?
- Pretty consistent trends across explorations with exception of domed-selectivity. No support for dome in early selex block (model will estimate asymptotic). No suggestion of dome selex though.

- Included ages as ghost fleet, and in fitting. Model with ages fit compares reasonably. Suggests some support of length data results with ages. Base model doesn't include fits to ages. 
- Continued evidence for sigmaR = 0.9 but not doing. Only reason is that it "seems" large. Where to explore what is reasonable?

Sigma R = 0.6 Comm NLL 369.766  Rec NLL 760.781  Total NLL 1174.04 

Sigma R = 0.9 Comm NLL 366.859  Rec NLL 746.623  Total NLL 1146.49

- Like washington, getting "warning: poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.00150056". Is this a concern?
- Jitter show 13/100 runs with poorer likelihoods (5 much poorer)
- Francis and MI have similar moderate data weighting effects. DM draws down the model the most. A little odd since weights are more dramatic for Francis and MI than DM. DM estimates lower R0 and some recdev differences.

Francis Comm = 0.15, rec = 0.22

### California

- "Base" model (4_0_base)
- Include recdevs but decision similar to WA model. Period of high recdevs followed by period of low. 
- Recent peak in recdevs sustains population.

- Model iterpreting catches to be supported by higher 90s recdevs, and rightward shifting comps later to reflect period of low recdevs (and period of lower catches). 
- Commercial comps have information for recdevs (due to when excluding them, comm selex shifts far left). One of the reasons to include in this model but not in WA model (other reason is bias adj pattern in "better")
- Similar patterns in comps as for WA with residual pattern.
- Blocking selex doesn't really change much plus no currently known reason for it. Some oddities with high mean length in
1993-1995, otherwise patterns are reasonable.
- Much more left shifted selectivity curve for recreational fishery than in other states. Evidence of domed selex?
- Data weighting effect is moderate. Very near boundaries of targets/limits

Notes:
WA
-Check projected catches compared to recdevs vs no recdevs to assess where scale is 
-Check data weighting for model with recdevs to see scale
-Perhaps do a SSS model for washington - would need depletion for a year. Jason says its easy to do
-Way to resolve sigmaR is does it creep? Does it improve fits things?
-Reinstall profiling package to resolved yaxis and better see the minimum
-Estimate M and Linf, since those with K are confounded. Profile K too. To address the profiles saying
Linf of 42 is best fitting
OR
-2015-2016 couldn't retain copper and quillback so dont have lengths
